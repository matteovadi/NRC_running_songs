Boys in blue’ll come, the rule of thumb, you gotta break into foot races
Grip the plastic, surge in (surgeon), nurse in (nursin')
‘K give the hood face lift
‘Fore I bow heads wit’ the mill’ (meal), you better pray to stay...in my good graces!
Good payments
Fuckin’ my bitch for free…
Nah, nigga, look for the upsale
Bill Cosby, pills probably
The work I put in (pudding) to fuck? Well, it’s insane
Padded wall thinking, you puttin’ me into what cell?
Lookin’ for work, out your mind, put a bullet in (bulletin) - what help?
That’s kinda crazy in that case, sing (casing)
And that case get put in this nutshell
You actin’ dumb? Well...on point lyin’, only if it’s a dunce cap
Get a round on your head
Leavin’ this world (whirl), spinnin’, it’s just that
The Cal’ lickin’ - how fittin’
Wiggin’, diggin’, then plug that
And what’s what? Good grade of hair
Nigga, you aware (wear) that this is that rough patch!
Up shit’s creek without a paddle, while it’s crawlin’ with critters
Denial (the Nile) levied (levee) against him in his current situation
Boy might be a fisher
Water you deposited, and that’s cold
When will I see (icy) the shivers!?
When everybody knows he’s runnin’ his mouth en route to...cry me a river!
He dates a whitey - this nigga
Uncool and as fake as time was
She do that not only to powder her nose, but it’s for your blow when she break ya lines up
So when she go to put her face on, K knows that it ain’t surprise ya
Paint the skies up
‘Cause medics to show up since it already takes her time up
MAC pow to (powder) the face
In this case - (*chk-chk*) - it’ll literally make his mind up
The fakest style, just...nothin’ real ‘bout family online
Just...you probably got real catfish parents
Discounted, nigga - plain (plane) to see (sea)
Bbbbrrrrr...how did that get clearance?
Here is the Filipino wordsmith
Only Earth purpose is to rap flip lyrics
Yeah, no lying, it’s a curse if (cursive) you ain’t get the word is…
Nigga, if the cap fits, (s)wear it
Time

QP the houseguest type
Never been about that life
I saw shit goin’ down, right? Soon as they booked the Southwest flight
Don’t let your mouth get right
Your chick? Don’t send for her
My opponents had been slaughtered, so what’s wit’ this shrimp order?
I been applyin’ for the Giants
Don’t get your friend tore up
How you permanently gettin’ badder (batter), but still got this...temp aura (tempura)?
Been swore in, bent corners
I took risks to meet the mark
I started wit’ a ki’...now I don’t need a key to start
The electric engine, eclectic vision
All my goals got metrics in ‘em
My father cold, neglectin’ visits, so it molded his death and distance
If I kill QP, why don’t you corner him in Heaven
And tell him his son said his absence was stronger than his presence?
I’m a monster wit’ a message
Wit’ blessings alight schemes
The right means to fight fiends, you gon’ replay tonight’s scenes
Nightmares of barrels blastin’, QP, it ain’t a pipe dream
It’s not your finest hour
You trappin’ to the highest power?
Gettin’ it coming overseas? I doubt you lying, coward
Snow angel: got you lyin’ about flying in the powder
Fuck the doubters - this a test
I disinfect, this bitch a pest
I offered JB to pay half just so you could get the wreck (direct)
I’m Donald Trump leavin’ Ivana: you could say we split the check (Czech)
This the West, I’m huntin’ still
Your royal team get hunt and killed
You’ll go from bein’ in the Kings’ guard...to seein’ if your Buddy healed (Hield)
I been runnin’ in muddy fields
You been tellin’ silly fables
QP, this what really made you
This ain’t a...easy kill they gave you
They hit us on a Wednesday...probably still ain’t paid you
I said, you could go by the weekend (Weeknd) if you think you really able (Abel)
‘Nother corpse to fill my stable, and this is what you got for me?
These Empire-watchin’ niggas? That network is not for me
Those politics a mockery, and maybe it’s the ‘Pac in me
But ask Michael J….just how shaky Fox could be
Nigga, this my property - you ain’t walkin’ me out
I probably doubt the fact you chalkin’ me out
You’ll get knocked ‘cause you not gon’ be knockin’ me out
I studied my poise and (poison) talks: I...call a G (toxicology) out
This is what E about…
These are gems I am givin’ you
Recognize what you listenin’ to
‘Cause when’s the last time you had witnessed a miracle?
It’s on you, my G

I say, what’s a trust fall?
Nigga, a trust fall is...can you catch yourself? No
Like will I join in the high school hall of fame, get all the stain, and hang myself from the rafters? Hell no
So if you on the edge, which means the ledge
People goin’ through depression sell souls
So upliftin’ words? Fat chance
Did that expression help? No
‘Cause when someone say you’re puttin’ on - wait (weight) - he just said that ya let yourself go
I’ll let a shell go, ammunition: that’s a must-get (musket)
Woo! I’m breakin’ it down
You half-eyein’ me crooked, that full metal jacket will straighten him out
Seven in the clip, one in the head, meaning only eight is allowed
Easy as pie (pi) - the reasoning why? ‘Cause he’s in my radius now
So if he die, am I the (diameter) reason? Well, I’ve been spacin’ it out
Walkin’ my perimeter, and just ended up...nigga, makin’ my rounds!
Talkin’ the most basic of loud - it ain’t medical
That surely ain’t for health
I kinda laughed at his reggie, like when Eddie Murphy played hisself
Mm-hmm? Mm-hmm?
Besides that home-grown, which I long known that he fuckin’ made himself
He’ll spend a day in Hell, tryin’ to stress and figure out which hybrid this hybrid seeds…
You’ll purely strain yourself
Nigga, the range is selfish
2020, I’m seein’ the view clear
I’ve been out a while now for cryin’ out loud
It’s nice to be in a new tier (tear)!
I say, the resolution is the weapon shootin’
If you drinkin’, the proof’s clear
Problem solved - if you drop the ball, just let me help you ring in the new year!
...And you queer!
Emerson Kennedy, women and men agree...you the girliest man
Talk about the toy lit (toilet)
Boy, shit! You’d enjoy pissin’, gettin’ swirlied again
Walkin’ around wit’ the caveman’s span - willpower (wheel power)...the earliest plan
Tryna smooth things out, while you circle the land
‘Caine enabled (Cain and Abel) the brother...you’ll discover...that that’s the service again
Blood required...love, desire...plus demise and the birth of a lamb!
Can’t enjoy the fruits of your labors during the squeeze
Jesus, you know how much this shit worth in the can?
Brother get jealous, what are you tryin’ to tell us? That the church breed the damned!
Out here tryna rap like Eminem mimickin’...nerdy as Stan!
Throwin’ mud in its earliest stage...as early as sand!
So don’t talk about doin’ dirt wit’ this nigga...or tryin’ to make a scurry to plan
‘Cause if he hear 'bout you doin’ somethin’ sick or ill, he gon’ try not dirty his hands!
...Time

Every battle feel like my final one…
It’s not ‘cause I’m tryin’ to run
Just I fell out of love wit’ rap...felt like my time has come
And it’s not ‘cause the violence won...it’s more ‘cause where I find the S.O.N
Lower bracket contrasted to where your rise begun
Your sob story kinda tore me
For you, I’m tryna carve a new one
Without downplayin’ what you’ve done, or hatin’ on your crew run
But how do I give you a classic and bring you to a new rung
When we both know the best QP you’ve been five years removed from?
What lately have you done? Couple funny new schemes?
This little funny routine got you rappin’ long as the money still green?
I’m as mad gettin’ you now while I’m huntin’ new things
As I would’ve been gettin’ excited for you back in 2015, nigga
So these vets seemin’ godly? Empty threats he embodies
Rap was s’posed to be your ticket, but I guess QP is sloppy
I don’t show my side hustle, I’m not just wrestlin’ with zombies
I’m runnin’ for the mayor while y’all just see (Jussie) the body
Don’t suggest recent homis, I’m different from those persons
You spittin’ those old verses, I’m ditch-diggin’ for yo’ service
Cops tryin’ to track my shoe marks, news said it was so worthless
Tryin’ to find me and them cells, how I left them soul-searchin’
So perfect...goals workin’
All your life, been tryin’ to scheme
Which kinda means you kinda mean, just not as keen what I have seen
I’ve lost way too many niggas, I’m tryna build a time machine
My heart (Hart) turned to blackened (Black and) Rock: it’s not a Jumanji scene
And you come from honest means
Now you a novice wit’ the drugs, no spot from decent plugs
That’s why yo’ stock won’t even budge
You’re Predator to my prey, That means I’m Arnold wit’ the snub
So when I’m coverin’ my face, you know I got it out the mud
This a dub, I need a thousand, to keep lessons compounding
Or I’ll throw down on purpose: it’s intentional grounding
These ain’t conventional rounds and
So save me the vet speech
Don’t “let’s speak” on chest beats!
Your heart don’t match, it’s just weak
I tell him, “Don’t take a breath...or we’ll see if the dead speak.”
Soon as he...exhale (Excel), coroner have to spread sheets
And the funeral is next week…
Ain’t no chance he makes it
Forgive that spreadsheet line - it was just a blanket statement
And you ain’t Michael Jackson, baby
You just fake it-fake it
QP, I ain’t gon’ exchange shots with you
On the West, we play make it-take it
Nigga, the goals I set you chase it
These are gems that I’m givin’ you
Recognize what you listenin’ to
‘Cause when’s the last time you had witnessed a miracle?

I say, yo...sir
You a creep, a John, a peeping Tom - fuck it, every one combined
A pedophile, protect your child
Public records...everyone could find
On the contract, when you get contact, you see that shit directly underlined
A real weirdo when he’s near hoes
If...maybe if Leslie wasn’t shy, he wouldn’t become the guy stalkin’ (stocking) these hoes
Knee to toe, even though it’s best to hug the thighs
Plus besides, off the rip, if it snags and shit, here’s a fashion tip: that’s somethin’ you shouldn’t run behind
Now that’s...crazy
If your woman’s fine, I’ll do a scaled attack on her and have my...way wit’ you
After she make my burger, King, theme music
I’ll have my way with you
Usher in a new era
Confession: I’ll have 'My Way' with you
Wicked, which (witch) means listen, explicit
Which means I’ll have my way
Wit’ you...actin’ like a Kings, then (Kingston) I gotta capitalize
I got ya makin’ (Jamaican) moves
Gettin’ bucks per clip - what’s this? Nigga, that’s pay-per-view!
And you gotta look at it from a lady’s view
If a bitch never seen a job well done, what does the bitch rarely find?
Bloody mistake, cuttin’ the plate...such a drip, steady knife
Blowjobs out of the water
The mouth of your daughter, she suck dick every time
I blow it out of proportion, and of course when she doesn’t...get every line
Even wit’ no crowd reaction, the way we stackin’, nigga, the chips gettin’ high
She’s interested - why?
Heh...sorta like magic ‘cause that’s when the bitch does the trick every time
Nigga, what’s good?
And for them dead presidents, I’mma truck you, cashin’ wit’ the piece
Decapitate ya...crack the safe to…
Rent-A-Cops? I’m snappin’ in the least
Go ‘head and carry on
No - heads in carry-ons
Actually what you see...is Eight Heads In A Duffel Bag
Must been had that that nigga practice what he preach!
I said, Emerson Kennedy, Emerson Kennedy
Did your parents think it through? That’s lame
Never trust a brother wit’ the government there to meet wit’ two last names
Yeah...yeah, the guy who doesn’t break the Kit-Kat down individually when he's tearin’ through that slang
For how he didn’t break the bar down
How bizarre how...he ain’t have a clue that’s strange
Then what happens?
I’m swimmin’ in coin into the point where I’m Ebeneezer Scrooge - that’s change
He likes to read my escorts’ books start to finish, so when he gets to the end and he’s like, “There’s the new Backpage”
And you’re more like Mr. Deeds if you look indeed, ‘cause, nigga, clearly you half-made (maid)
Then what happens?
Leave him down in slow-motion - oh, you ain’t heard the new Max Payne!
Nigga, time

I’ve been tryin’ to find where your fire went…
‘Cause I damn sure witnessed the rise of it
Your unrivaled wit unraveled, which spiraled quick to lighter shit
This current design in all your rhymin’ feel like Ramen in your diet shit
These quick meals you pitch deal ain’t headlining flyer shit
Those deadlines expire quick
Now you’re headlinin’ Chrysler whips
How you homeless, nigga?
I honed this inner chi (energy) like Iron Fist
You intervene? I line your shit
The bigotry I’m fightin’ wit’
Prove White Men Can’t Jump me: Sidney Dean, the visor flip
How they place me wit’ Woody Harrelson, when this specific flick is destiny?
‘Cause even if your hook shot land, only gon’ place your chick in Jeopardy
Ya faith a distant memory
There’s lessons on rewinds
Revealed cracks in your attacks via “presence” and deep lines
Only a blessing to weak minds
Now you messin’ wit’ me time
‘Cause shooting stars can’t keep shining taking legends on decline
So this a uphill battle, one I knew I couldn’t win
‘Cause I’ll never get to battle that QP you should’ve been
A reminder of what shoulda been, when you was bold wit’ the pencil
And you right - you are my biggest fear...and that’s bein’ old wit’ potential
Ain’t walk that road you was meant to, and the plans you made was foul
Lack of evolution led to this antiquated style
Now it’s easily replicated - don’t have plans to change it now
‘Cause the reason he never made it’s why demand’s erasin’ now
You lack that classic spark
The rap that had your massive start
Only made you yesterday’s GOAT in today’s Jurassic Park
When fans, in violent rages, decide who shine in stages
They say everyone’s getting hotter, but I decline to find the faces
Fuck the ladder to success if every time I climb, it (climate) changes
These are miracles I am givin’ you
Recognize what you listenin’ to

Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

Turn it up
Turn it up
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on

Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will

Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me
That ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me
In some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Muthafuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first",271946,https://images.genius.com/528cdbb31382864e77cf902b2c65ff73.1000x1000x1.png,0.376,0.841,3,-4.348,0,,0.0435,0.0,0.578,0.463,76.052,0.356

Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-century schizoid man)

The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)

Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, goddamnit, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How Ye doing? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hidin'?
I got the power make your life so excitin'

Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Mmm, now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window, letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

Diamonds all on my ring nigga
Gold watches, gold chain nigga
Hundred thou' on champagne nigga
Yeah my money insane nigga
Yeah I'm making it rain nigga
But I was just on the plane nigga
Buying gear, flying here
Fuck what you heard, it’s my time of year
If I'm in the club, I get a hundred stacks
I'm always rolling up so I get love for that
Them niggas stole my swag but I don't want it back
My nigga uh! I was on this, but now I'm onto that
You see it in my closet before it's on the rack
Was out there in Hawaii, now I'm goin back
My nigga uh! I got so much money I should start a bank
So much paper right in front of me it's hard to think
Buy so many bottles it's gon' be hard to drink
But I'm still pourin' up and my family here and they rolling up so uh!

The bigger the bill, the harder you ball
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long
The quicker you here, the faster you go
That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..

You can tell by who I'm on the phone with
Yeah nigga talking about grown shit
Niggas too busy jacking my swag
Need to fuck around, get your own shit
Get your own cars, get your own clothes
Get your own smoke, get your own bitch

Make sure you do whatever is that you gotta do, that's your job
And niggas gon' hate but that's no prob'
So hey fuck 'em don't need nothing from 'em
Some niggas talking but the shit they claiming don't mean nothing
It's straight from Cali, that's what's in my joint that's what I'm puffin', OG
And been one since I was young enough to know that everybody was gonna know me
Most niggas don't see

Are you the Spanish fucking Syco?
Muhfucka tried to pick the Apple from his iPhone
Are you out your fricking mind?
You went on Pimp My Ride and Xzibit tried to switch your low rider to a bigger size
While 55 of your cousins could fit inside
I'll have your siblings lay on their stomachs on my grass in a single line
I'll run, jump, land on their dripping spines
And use their wet backs as a Spic N Slide
Johnny Storm is a comic book character, the kind you idolize
Most superheroes save all kinds of lives
You couldn't even save Grind Time from their demise
You're hyped up for jerking The Saurus and Real Deal that straight up is rotten
Batman should be the superhero that you've gotten
Cause you couldn't of achieved your fucking fame without Robbin/robbing
These bars are crystal meth so start to give respect when I supply your addiction
Now you looking to get more as I'm cooking up a Storm like Walter White in the kitchen
You've never been that great your status is very low
You're as respected in the states as the accent of Cheryl Cole
And Mexicans could not be superheroes, that's crazy bro
Imagine if kids were in a burning house as flames arose
Like, ""Please Jonny Storm come save us both!""
He'd be like, ""Nah, I'm too lazy holmes.""
Lunar C filmed me as I stuck my dick in your damn mom
Either she's loose or this really is mad long
Cause she fisted herself as I fucked her ass and I swear I felt her give me a hand job
Then Eur' and Sensa joined in to have some more fun
We filmed a porno as we smashed your whore mom
Called it a Fantastic Foursome
Bitch I got a lot of rage, I'm spitting up in Jonny's face
Y'all pit Johnny Knoxville in the ring with Johnny Cage
Jonny's in a body bag, I'll zip him and his girl up
You're just a Jonny in England I'm Johnny Wilkinson's kick to win the the World Cup

Wow, them Spanish jokes were overly used
Didn't you just make these Don't Flop shirts? Why is yours older than you?
Must've took the wrong shirt off of Cruger's bed
Look, where the FUCK are your sideburns?!
They are sad as shit
Everyday you try to shave is an embarrassment
See in battling there really is no comparison
I didn't sleep on this kid but I'm sure Michael Jackson did
You see how he ain't laugh a bit, that shit is accurate
There ain't a girl that he's banging cause it is permanent damage
I flew on British Airways and I guarantee you came on Virgin Atlantic
Why'd you make me rap against the Sherminator?
You dress like an urban raver
If I beat his ass, he'll be back with insurance papers
An ugly bitch would have you whipped like a circus trainer
Even if she was as big as a suburban and made your piss burn like a bourbon chaser
Look, if Doogie Howser had just a nursing major in his show
Then he would've been the perfect player for the role
But if you ever see him pull a pager from his robe
Just know cause his fucking dad took away his phone
Yo, Eur' didn't bring his ass, he ran away from home
Cause your pops wouldn't claim a little faggot named Charron
Before you cry yourself to sleep, you masturbate alone
And every time you try to yell you hit this aggravating tone
See I came to beat that bitch out you, cause I'm a man of my word
And honestly, I don't take my chances with nerds
He a gangsta from the Canada burbs
So when he say he got Eagle on he might literally brandish a bird
As soft as you are you'll never live what you say
You just talk like a mark in a fictional way
But you could end up missing today
Cause of you this should be a walk in the park cause that's where little bitches get raped
When he heard we'd be close to  Lane
It took two air marshals to get Charron off his plane
If you act like a thug you'll get slaughtered before your rap starts
I'll put his Blood In The Water like we wanted to attract sharks
Shit, I'm Floridia's proven with the northern influence
Building pensions with the veterans like we forming a Union
There's a reason he ain't part of the movement
We'll consider you an MC when you really start recording some music
Faggot

O'shea told me to say, ""Fuck this American guy.""
I am the Sherminator, I stuck my dick in your little sister's American Pie
And what shade are you? You look like a fucking cancer patient
And yo, you brought up Michael Jackson but you look like him stuck in between transformation
In tracks he claims he grips and sparks and bangs out a crew
Bitch, I've seen O'shea take shits on sharks more gangster than you
You sleep with 30 cousins sprawled on a foam couch
When Mexicans play the hand their dealt it's always a full house
Real talk-real taco
He has the craziest crib
I went in his washroom and his mom was blazing a spliff
He was shaving and eight of his kids tried selling me hot dogs while I was taking a shit
Straight up this bitch don't respect your country or the motherfucking scene you got
I bet he even thought that Mr. Bean was a burrito shop
He's a twat
He doesn't like your people's country
He thought Blood In The Water was a documentary on Ian Huntley
It ain't even funny
Jonny could take more
Him and his brothers have sword fights jerking off to some gay porn and call it a brain Storm
What are you? The Fantastic Four matador?
This Spaniard is poor
He beat  for a stack and even demanded for more
Jonny Storm, if you BBM me again you won't be as Fantastic as before
The Human Torch is behind the curve
So act bold and get dressed in all black when I bury Storm
This guy wants a free vacation
He said ""Fly me out cause I don't have decent wages"", well
I don't believe that statement
I seen him on Facebook flashing money on a  with heaps of Haitians
So I guess Corey Charron ain't the only one lying to people's faces
This rapper fucking bores us
You paid a stack for this performance?
That's the biggest waste of money on a Spanish guy since Torres
He's a diva I can see but ain't the least bit surprised
You ain't squaring off with Brits cause you're scared the audience wouldn't be on your side
He even declined to battle Freddy, you need to put your ego aside
What makes you think you'd last against Cruger? Your people fall asleep all the time
You owe your life to Rowan Faife
He let you choose your opponent for some useful promotion
You haven't battled in a year there's no route you were going
You people usually use a rag to cruise through the ocean
So this ain't the first time that your kind make moves off of Rowan (rowing)

It's so funny
I've battled less than a week ago, so that's a flat liar
You stole your punchline for Sahtyre and -
Fuck it
Look, there's no need to talk about great flips cause your style's sick
No bitch, don't even clown bish, I dissed your outfit but your cowlick looks like you've been sucking a cow's dick
Fuck it, they call me Storm cause I hit 'em with a whirlwind
Have this bitch kissing my fist more than Blizzard and his girlfriend
You got real cocky since you fucked Ronda on Road Trip
But you still choppy, syllable sloppy with old flips
My flow spits super hot fire when I chew niggas
While you rap with more hand movements than mute spitters
Who's this loser? Crooked Jr?
Y'all bring this kid to the hood like he's a gang member
But this kid in the hood, that's just a clan member
Bitch, your sexual preference is transgender
You're into testicles, rectums and hand gestures
Yo, if Rone was a girl, his name would be Charron
So to the world you're basically a clone
In the states he's unknown cause you lose every battle of your cadence-y alone
I tried to school him on dub step and grime
You came dressed with the wrong subject in mind
Shit is stressful though
How you expect to be impressing hoes when you invested doe in all these Tim Westwood clothes?
Speaking of which, when you came to the states and battled Amzilla your freestyles were faker than Drakes
Yo that was 50 straight rounds of simple action
I'll lyrically pound and rip combatants
Your shitty sounding fiction rapping is about as real as Nicki Minaj's British accent
See you Young Money so watch your dorky tongue
Cause you're be on a Cart' to the E.R. and I ain't gotta show Corey guns/Gunz
You're the biggest geek ever
You'll never get up to my rap placement
My scheme's better, clean set ups to punish and castrate him
To me you'll only be a sucker that's mad racist
Looking like the Team America puppet of Matt Damon
I'm saying, try something different for four bars
He ain't clever he's Mayweather
Keep stuffing weak punches and hopes he wins on the scorecards
But when you look at the punch stats they nothing but love taps
And one power shot is crushing your comeback
I'll shatter Charron's hope like a savage it's no joke
He ain't even at my status, he average with no quotes
Speed bag him, weave jab him to slap in a choke hold
Lean back, squeeze, snap him, you battling grown folk
Shit, yo this is like that movie The Great White Hype
Cause they like, ""Who the fuck is you?""
Competition wise you're below what I'm accustom to
So I'll build up his confidence, let him land a punch or two
Then knock him the fuck out as soon as they seen enough of you

Yo fuck this Russell Peters
Everything you spit ain't something meaner
I thought you would talk about Tim Westwood like he did, trying to rock a muscle T-shirt
But I lost all respect for you like Westwood when he put on Justin Bieber
Yo, watch how I'm rapping now, you're the wackest clown
I am Mayweather and I'm smacking down Pacquiao
I googled, ""Mexicans in London"" and it said that there was nothing
You must hate this country
Your people work for next to nothing cause you were straight up dummies
Mexicans like marathons, just a stupid race we all use for making money
Everything I spit raw, brought up Nicki Minaj, you look like her with her wig off
Ayo, and you gotta realize that this is happening
Well fuck a Storm cause you know that I be rapping in
He's like the only Mexican here and I fricking love it
Spanish culture is like Madeleine McCann, you won't find it in London
See our countries have talent we'll forever be different
From Gretzky to Dickens, John Lennon and many musicians
All you have is drunken Guido that end up in prison and fucking Jessica Simpson
George Bush has screws loose in his head that are missing
You're the only country who's Special Olympics has their presidents in it
American teachers don't mention other countries when they lecture their infants
Quit being hardheaded just listen
And remember that Britain's the sole reason that your people's independence was given
You're nothing, you're bluffing, you ain't something to remember
You'd swear it's Guy Fawkes day the way I'm burning this dummy in November
You buckle from pressure, the bitches you fuck get no pleasure
It's funny how every whore that Storms on top of is feeling under the weather
Against Sonny you said ""you're so pale I'm surprised you don't come with a shovel""
That's an epic fail, I don't need to fucking rebuttal
See you're famous off of robberies, you ain't catching respect
You winning is a stroke of luck like Professor Green scratching his neck
And you're not that Spanish, you're Dirtbag Dan-ish
That's the truth
Bitch you only have Spanish roots cause your mum's a prostitute on a beach in Magaluf
Johnny Storm's the Human Torch but I'm questioning his name
How are you the Human Torch when you're never spitting flames?
Oh well this bitch is lame, smoke spell is a finished phase
I just lit up a Torch in London like I started the '012 Olympic Games

A: I'm Dominican
Sooo....okay
I don't need no fuck rebuttal when you look like you stepping in some nut puddles, bitch
When Corey Charron gets horny alone
He treats his ass like a rotary phone
Bitch, I was born the same year as Beat Street
You were born the same year as Pete & Pete
Shit, I been spitting from the head since you been pissing in your bed
Most consistent with the lyrics kicked against the best
But made this one exception cause it's simple as it gets
See all your ignorant verses about Hispanics is impertinent bitch
My English is perfect
If that's the best angle you picking to work with
Then you 'bout to get your ass roasted like you tried to shit in a furnace
Look, a match with you is hardly an interest or purpose
I just did it send a message directed to Sketch Menace
B, quit ducking me
You had your chance to follow the leader but you hid behind your company
Verbally, can't none of y'all fuck with me
So if Charron does come off the dome it's just so Pat Stay can suck a free'
Yo, you was all proud to be voted ""class clown"" like a geek
Shit, King Of The Dot, put money where their mouth is
So in Don't Flop I'll pound in your cheek
That'll leave him laid out in the streets
And dead jokes, so ironically you'll be left with the red coat like your mounted police
Rip him apart, I ain't praising these gimmicks
Acting like King Of The Dot the greatest that did it
That's why they got you battling for chains, y'all slaves to the business
Bring your top ten, shit they all buried with you
In Canada it's illegal to own a gun
Cause your police only carry whistles
Y'all came to Cali' like some cocaine ambassadors
Looking for something to sniff fresh off the plane like scavengers
Acting so vein/vain, it's vascular
Cause getting robbed in Canada is common as jobs in Africa
But y'alls history was easily planned
It made shit as good as it gets
But if it wasn't for The Treaty Of Paris when the British defeated France
Shit Canada wouldn't exist
So you must be out your fucking mind if you think I won't smash this cunt
You so skinny, if you wore a seat belt it'd collapse your lung
In a clash of puns, punches and jagged tongues
One Shaolin finger jab would crack this punk
And drop money on his mouth like some platinum fronts
Yo, you can't even speak French you need to practice some
You know less about your roots than a bastard son
I administer punches so potent and sinister
They hitting until your bones brittle like you soaked them in vinegar
You play me and I'll painfully finish ya

Or you risk having imperfect bread. Byron wrote,
“The greatest pleasure in life is drinking hock
And soda water the morning after, when one has
A hangover,” or words to that effect. It is a
Pleasure, for me, of the past. I do not drink so much
Any more. And when I do, I am not in sufficiently good
Shape to enjoy the hock and seltzer in the morning.
I am envious of this pleasure as I think of it. Do not
You be envious. In fact I cannot tell envy
From wish and desire and sharing imperfectly
What others have got and not got. But envy is a good word
To use, as hate is, and lust, because they make their point
In the worst and most direct way, so that as a
Result one is able to deal with them and go on one’s way.
I read Don Juan twenty years ago, and six years later
I wrote a poem in emulation of it. I began
Searching for another stanza but gave in
To the ottava rima after a while, after I’d tried
Some practice stanzas in it; it worked so well
It was too late to stop, it seemed to me. Do not
Be in too much of a hurry to emulate what
You admire. Sometimes it may take a number of years
Before you are ready, but there it is, building
Inside you, a constructing egg. Low-slung
Buildings are sometimes dangerous to walk in and
Out of. A building should be at least one foot and a half
Above one’s height, so that if one leaps
In surprise or joy or fear, one’s head will not be injured.
Very high ceilings such as those in Gothic
Churches are excellent for giving a spiritual feeling.
Low roofs make one feel like a mole in general. But
Smallish rooms can be cosy. Many tiny people
In a little room make an amusing sight. Large
Persons, both male and female, are best seen out of doors.
Ships sided against a canal’s side may be touched and
Patted, but sleeping animals should not be, for
They may bite, in anger and surprise. Of all animals
The duck is seventeenth lowliest, the eagle not as high
On the list as one would imagine, rating
Only ninety-fifth. The elephant is either two or four
Depending on the author of the list, and the tiger
Is seven. The lion is three or six. Blue is the
Favorite color of many people because the sky
Is blue and the sea is blue and many people’s eyes
Are blue, but blue is not popular in those countries
Where it is the color of mold. In Spain blue
Symbolizes cowardice. In America it symbolizes “Americanness.”
The racial mixture in North America should
Not be misunderstood. The English came here first,
And the Irish and the Germans and the Dutch. There were
Some French here also. The Russians, the Jews, and
The Blacks came afterwards. The women are only coming now
To a new kind of prominence in America, where “Liberation”
Is their byword. Giraffes, which people ordinarily
Associate with Africa, can be seen in many urban zoos
All over the world. They are an adaptable animal,
As Greek culture was an adaptable culture. Rome
Spread it all over the world. You should know,
Before it did, Alexander spread it as well. Read
As many books as you can without reading interfering
With your time for living. Boxing was formerly illegal
In England, and also, I believe, in America. If
You feel a law is unjust, you may work to change it.
It is not true, as many people say, that
That is just the way things are. Or, Those are the rules,
Immutably. The rules can be changed, although
It may be a slow process. When decorating a window, you
Should try to catch the eye of the passerby, then
Hold it; he’or she should become constantly more
Absorbed in what is being seen. Stuffed animal toys should be
Fluffy and a pleasure to hold in the hands. They
Should not be too resistant, nor should they be made
With any poisonous materials. Be careful not to set fire
To a friend’s house. When covering over
A gas stove with paper or inflammable plastic
So you can paint the kitchen without injuring the stove,
Be sure there is no pilot light, or that it is out.
Do not take pills too quickly when you think you have a cold
Or other minor ailment, but wait and see if it
Goes away by itself, as many processes do
Which are really part of something else, not
What we suspected. Raphael’s art is no longer as popular
As it was fifty years ago, but an aura
Still hangs about it, partly from its former renown.
The numbers seven and eleven are important to remember in dice
As are the expressions “hard eight,” “Little Joe,” and “fever,”
Which means five. Girls in short skirts when they
Kneel to play dice are beautiful, and even if they
Are not very rich or good rollers, may be
Pleasant as a part of the game. Saint Ursula
And her eleven thousand virgins has
Recently been discovered to be a printer’s mistake;
There were only eleven virgins, not eleven thousand.
This makes it necessary to append a brief explanation
When speaking of Apollinaire’s parody Les
Onze Mille Verges, which means eleven thousand
Male sexual organs—or sticks, for beating. It is a pornographic book.
Sexual information should be obtained while one is young
Enough to enjoy it. To learn of cunnilingus at fifty
Argues a wasted life. One may be tempted to
Rush out into the streets of Hong Kong or
Wherever one is and try to do too much all in one day.
Birds should never be chased out of a nature sanctuary
And shot. Do not believe the beauty of people’s faces
Is a sure indication of virtue. The days of
Allegory are over. The Days of Irony are here.
Irony and Deception. But do not harden your heart. Remain
Kind and flexible. Travel a lot. By all means
Go to Greece. Meet persons of various social
Orders. Morocco should be visited by foot,
Siberia by plane. Do not be put off by
Thinking of mortality. You live long enough. There
Would, if you lived longer, never be any new
People. Enjoy the new people you see. Put your hand out
And touch that girl’s arm. If you are
Able to, have children. When taking pills, be sure
You know what they are. Avoid cholesterol. In conversation
Be understanding and witty, in order that you may give
Comfort and excitement at the same time. This is the
high road to popularity
And social success, but it is also good
For your soul and for your sense of yourself. Be supportive of others
At the expense of your wit, not otherwise. No
Joke is worth hurting someone deeply. Avoid contagious diseases.
If you do not have money, you must probably earn some
But do it in a way that is pleasant and does
Not take too much time. Painting ridiculous pictures
Is one good way, and giving lectures about yourself is another.
I once had the idea of importing tropical birds
From Africa to America, but the test cage of birds
All died on the ship, so I was unable to become
Rich that way. Another scheme I had was
To translate some songs from French into English, but
No one wanted to sing them. Living outside Florence
In February, March, and April was an excellent idea
For me, and may be for you, although I recently revisited
The place where I lived, and it is now more “built up”;
Still, a little bit further out, it is not, and the fruit trees
There seem the most beautiful in the world. Every day
A new flower would appear in the garden, or every other day,
And I was able to put all this in what I wrote. I let
The weather and the landscape be narrative in me. To make money
By writing, though, was difficult. So I taught
English in a university in spite of my fear that
I knew nothing. Do not let your fear of ignorance keep you
From teaching, if that would be good for you, nor
Should you let your need for success interfere with what you love,
In fact, to do. Things have a way of working out
Which is nonsensical, and one should try to see
How that process works. If you can understand chance,
You will be lucky, for luck is what chance is about
To become, in a human context, either
Good luck or bad. You should visit places that
Have a lot of savour for you. You should be glad
To be alive. You must try to be as good as you can.
I do not know what virtue is in an absolute way,
But in the particular it is excellence which does not harm
The material but ennobles and refines it. So, honesty
Ennobles the heart and harms not the person or the coins
He remembers to give back. So, courage ennobles the heart
And the bearer’s body; and tenderness refines the touch.
The problem of being good and also doing what one wishes
Is not as difficult as it seems. It is, however,
Best to get embarked early on one’s dearest desires.
Be attentive to your dreams. They are usually about sex,
But they deal with other things as well in an indirect fashion
And contain information that you should have.
You should also read poetry. Do not eat too many bananas.
In the springtime, plant. In the autumn, harvest.
In the summer and winter, exercise. Do not put
Your finger inside a clam shell or
It may be snapped off by the living clam. Do not wear a shirt
More than two times without sending it to the laundry.
Be a bee fancier only if you have a face net. Avoid flies,
Hornets, and wasps. Clasp other people’s hands firmly
When you are introduced to them. Say “I am glad to meet you!”
Be able to make a mouth and cheeks like a fish. It
Is entertaining. Speaking in accents
Can also entertain people. But do not think
Mainly of being entertaining. Think of your death.
Think of the death of the fish you just imitated. Be
artistic, and be unfamiliar.
Think of the blue sky, how artists have
Imitated it. Think of your secretest thoughts,
How poets have imitated them. Think of what you feel
Secretly, and how music has imitated that. Make a moue.
Get faucets for every water outlet in your
House. You may like to spend some summers on
An island. Buy woolen material in Scotland and have
The cloth cut in London, lapels made in France.
Become religious when you are tired of everything
Else. As a little old man or woman, die
In a fine and original spirit that is yours alone.
When you are dead, waste, and make room for the future.
Do not make tea from water which is already boiling.
Use the water just as it starts to boil. Otherwise
It will not successfully “draw” the tea, or
The tea will not successfully “draw” it. Byron
Wrote that no man under thirty should ever see
An ugly woman, suggesting desire should be so strong
It affected the princeliest of senses; and Schopenhauer
Suggested the elimination of the human species
As the way to escape from the Will, which he saw as a monstrous
Demon-like force which destroys us. When
Pleasure is mild, you should enjoy it, and
When it is violent, permit it, as far as
You can, to enjoy you. Pain should be
Dealt with as efficiently as possible. To “cure” a dead octopus
You hold it by one leg and bang it against a rock.
This makes a noise heard all around the harbor,
But it is necessary, for otherwise the meat would be too tough.
Fowl are best plucked by humans, but machines
Are more humanitarian, since extended chicken
Plucking is an unpleasant job. Do not eat unwashed beets
Or rare pork, nor should you gobble uncooked dough.
Fruits, vegetables, and cheese make an excellent diet.
You should understand some science. Electricity
Is fascinating. Do not be defeated by the
Feeling that there is too much for you to know. That
Is a myth of the oppressor. You are
Capable of understanding life. And it is yours alone
And only this time. Women who appeal to you
Should be told so, and loved, if you can, but no one
Should be able to shake you so much that you wish to
Give up. The sensations you feel are caused by outside
Phenomena and inside impulses. Whatever you
Experience is both “a person out there” and a dream
As well as unwashed electrons. It is your task to see this through
To a conclusion that makes sense to all concerned
And that reflects credit on this poem, your species, and yourself.
Now go. You cannot come back until these lessons are learned
And you can show that you have learned them for yourself.",245640,https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1625765384,0.817,0.599,0,-9.249,0,,0.132,0.000311,0.0873,0.548,108.873,0.0328

Your days are numbered like a calendar check the name and the date
The street life is what we livin someone is dead everyday
So better watch your back coz your death is maybe today
And money ain’t the root of evil its actually lacking the paper
So I, make moves with the gun upon my waist
Coz I don’t wanna wait for trouble coming down my way
Shay’intshiza qal’ekhanda pack my gun and run away
In every night, shots and screeming keeping me wide awake
And dog I’ll find a way out of the hood and that’s my daily word
Spit my heart on a fat beat make shit you never heard
I don’t do sleep move tik and ever burn
Fuck the worm, my mission is eating the early bird so
Lord forgive for the sins I know I won’t repeat
The drug business, robbery even the wars on streets
The blood is dripping off my fingers when I hold the heat
Repented now and what I put on the table is only peace!

OK, let’s cut the talk!
Zwakalis’iMela iph’iKnife neFork

Don’t get it twisted, straight up – not the other way around

Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead
Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
Money, power, respect, street cred, yeah
It's scary, ain't it? Picture yourself going out as a hero
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
We watched, so many piggybacked off of
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
These tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lives
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
To see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest must be the strongest
In this concrete jungle where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starving
Or it could just be somebody's aura, that just horri-fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
In his entou-rage that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it

Since B.I.G. taught us niggas to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencing the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rolling, going through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
When Ready to Die was a sick part of my life
Palming that forty-five, plotting to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular, huh?
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I

I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
Into the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passing
All I did was build a dynasty off of his passion
And I'm addressing the adolescents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back
And I visit your grave 'cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yelling ""God bless""
Regardless to critics yelling that East/West
I seen the game losing, I'm just pressing the reset
And when the resurrection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally
I'ma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest

In the future is fading
When I say
That the lust for life is waning
Exult with me, when I say that the end is nigh

Die with me, my dear love
Die with me, my dear love

I'd do things differently, yeah, I wouldn't think twice
I distract myself, think of someone else
But every now and then you remind me

It's only when I'm lying in bed on my own
And I wake up and I don't see your name on my phone
'Til the moments where I think that I'm better alone
That's when I remember, that's when I remember
Every time I walk past your house in the rain
And I tell myself that you were the biggest mistake
Then just when I think I'm finally doing okay
That's when I remember, that's when I remember

My friends tell me I shouldn't listen
To the voices that go round in my head
So I try to delete all the memories
But you're really hard to forget

Flip that thang thang don't stop it

Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringin' me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo, singin' on my own
Now I can't find the key without you

And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So, if you want the truth

I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

I'm sorry if it's all too much
Every day you're here, I'm healin'
And I was runnin' outta luck
I never thought I'd find this feelin'
'Cause I've been hearin' symphonies
Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me (A rhapsody for you and me)
And every melody is timeless

And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So, if you want the truth

I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah

And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth (Oh)

Will you hold me tight and not let go?

Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
‘Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on the 18th birthday, he found out it wasn't his?

(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger

Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down

La-da-da-da-di-da-da-a, la-a (La-a, la-a, la-a)
Let me tell you, I'm out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.

Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, ""Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy""

Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.

Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)!
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!

I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your pla-, pla-, pla-

Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

Dear Lord, when I get to heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

Something so wholesome about you

No ""Who cares?"", no vacant stare
No time for me

Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

There's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin?
Babe
There's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this
Oh, what a sin

To the strand, a picnic planned
For you and me
A rope in hand for your other man
To hang from a tree

There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now

3bidbhpOYeV4knp8AIu8Xn,Can't Hold Us - feat. Ray Dalton,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,[],https://open.spotify.com/track/3bidbhpOYeV4knp8AIu8Xn,84,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Got up)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough

But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim her heart can't take the anesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin
Hey, chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was nine?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin', like, ""What kind of doctor can we fly in?""
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now, she'd be okay?
But since she was just a secretary
Working for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here?
My grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse, ""Did you do the research?""
She asked me, ""Can you sign some t-shirts?""
""Bitch, is you smokin reefer?
You don't see that we hurt?"" But still–

I smile
When Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

They outside of the emergency room, room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now, she 'sleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus, my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Klaye and Aunt Jean
So many aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's just ""1 Thing""
When they said that she made it, you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
'Cause with my family, we know where home is
So instead of sending flowers, we the roses

I smile
When Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

'Cause Rosie brings the sunshine (Oh)

I smile
When Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

I smile
When Rosie comes to see me
And I'm sad when Rosie goes away
'Cause Rosie brings the sunshine (Say)

Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I, can't wait
No, can't wait, for
For a sunny day
Momma can't wait
For the clouds to break

Just wanna ask you a question, um, have you, have you
Have you been in love, before?

You like your vodka with a little touch of lime
You should pro'bly take your heels off, 'cause you been runnin' through my mind
Oh baby, they say we're no good for each other
And I can't really tell, what is this spell you put me under?
Your love's not too kind to me

Love is power, swear there's somethin' 'bout her that make me nervous
Mother Earth done gave us all a gift, she made you perfect
Let's eat some mushrooms and go to the circus
Girl, you know I'm lovin' you just like you deserve it (Ou)
So, baby, make me earn it, show me the way you work it
Tell me what you afraid of, I'll spit you my favorite verses
Let's... just go take a breath
I want it all, every ounce of love that you got left
You are my drug, in love to death, feel free to fall, you are a catch
I'm in your heart, I'm in your dream, so fuck the world, it's you and me

If her love don't last forever then forever ain't the same, yeah

Your love is not too kind to me

Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back
She hid around corners, and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses, and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive

The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too, oh

Struck from a great height
By someone who should have known better than that

You sure?
Couldn’t tell by lookin ya tapes over
The way I see it, you're only here cause Smack just needed it to make quota
They keep sayin', ""This a layup.""
Nah, this shit a layover
Jayhova (Jeyhova), sound like the Roc, but this a 'Takeover'
I’ma get rid a you
Snitch nigga in gen pop, a shoulder bump could be the end of you
I don’t needa get physical, I got plenty more options
That's still as physical, meanin’ I’m lookin over ya coffin
I mark men, marksmen, where ya war wounds? Harm who?
No knife, or a gun, wit’ just a pen I could sharp shoot
Okay he animated but I’ma mechanic, so either way it’s a cartoon (car tune)
They said ""Bando"" I heard ""open house"", see either way it's a walk thru
It’s real bad, stompin' out any fight that he still have
They’ll say he died wit’ Honor, if you ask me he might as well have
Lil’ frail ass nigga, get put to sleep tryna fuck wit’ Jey
Anybody pass by, ""Oh. He just turned 21 today.""
The MadKing
Niggas can only talk tough in a public place
""Jey give him a break.""
Fuck that, they keep givin' him plates
And the shit that they give me not even minimum wage
I’m fuckin' starvin', and the homeless look, prolly gives it away
So it don’t matter if he fuckin' trash he still finna get ate
Lemme be more clear, the way I see it this warfare
Force fear, if the judges pick you, we goin' off air
Headlock, he’ll lose feelin' in his legs like a lawn chair
I'll let him go!
But not before I let him know he don’t belong here
The fuck is this?! Lookin' like his moms dropped him off here
Now I’m gettin' upset, you makin' it this far I really didn’t expect
But now it’s gon' take a super Ru (Subaru) just to fit in the test
Subaru, this a crash course, and yeah I didn’t forget
I couldn’t even get Strapped In, they knew it’s finna be wreck
I’ll beat you to death
Round 1, I ain’t done wit’ you yet

Question!...that we all know the answer to
Ain't you a choke artist!?
I see how much it damaged you
But you been clean the whole tournament, ever since JayBlac and Hennyman started ampin' you
It's Moana...this Samoan nigga needed the hook-up to turn into that animal
You PUSSY! This my shit!
Y'all got Jey beatin' Bando? Nonsense!
Glock spit!
In order for you to dodge this
Better jump a couple air-
You better jump a couple feet in the air: drop kick
As far as my last one, they said it was not it
So they gave me Wing for nothin': ostrich!
I'm at his job quick!
4 to 12 before he done wit' his shift
Wit' the shotgun, put the pump to his ribs
It's like he workin' a triple when I'm done wit' this bitch
I hold it over Nite (overnight), then hit him wit' the double again!
Or I catch him while he go in his crib! I'm not jokin'!
A dumdum (dumb-dumb) followin' Jey (J): it's a high moment
Sleep paralysis: his body still, but his eyes open!
Smoke his kid!
They like, ""Not the child - that shit is outta place.""
I tell 'em, ""Pocket dial"": I hit him by mistake
Lil' nigga caught in crossfire: this the KKK
We not gon' play!
I need that money, nigga, so I need to win
You ever smoked weed with your chiefin' friends?
Well, after I light up Jey (J), never to be seen again!
When I see his bitch, dome shot, holdin' her head on some grievin' shit
I did your other half bad like a evil twin!
It's me and him!
SHUT THE FUCK UP, nigga! Don't speak!
This body gon' have me sittin' up top: nosebleeds
Suite Life of Zack & Cody, aim it at this bitch
Now you ahead of the tip then (Tipton): Mr. Moseby
It'll be GTA if my bros creep
See Jey (CJ), make him block a semi: Grove Street!
You don't know me!
I'll let four hit him
Brain matter, all over the floor and shit
Nasty, especially when the morgue get him
Wing blood'll be drippin' out the bag: raw chicken
Rap, nigga

I'ma be honest nigga, you're not worth three of my rounds
In this tournament you clearly got the cheesiest style
All I see is a clown, you and I are nothin' the same
A poor mans Hitman, just wit’ a gun and a name
A couple coke flip, periodic dope shit, but none of the pain
They don’t believe you, Kylie Jenner, ya see through
Transparent (trans parent), beat who?
The fans don’t even need you, to advance I only need two
But I brought 3, more like 2 and a babe
Bando dried up, it ain’t shit he could do for a Jey
I should just choke, off bravado I can’t lose anyway
I am the GOAT
Avocado I wrote for Ru in a day (Ruin Your Day) the fuck you gon’ say?
Nothin'
Just stand there and act stupid
That’s why they see 'Bando' way behind the king, it's trap muzick
It's that ruthless
You either bankin’ on Jey (J) or you glass shootin'
I ain’t Your Honor, this a different court pressure, adapt to it
I'll dap you when you can rap through a round without squeezin' a piece
See me I don’t needa be shootin' niggas, niggas need to shoot me
They only talk that way when they don’t mind losin' they teeth
Every time you smile it be like the movies when niggas choosin' they seats
I’m abusive, that handgun won’t do shit
Kung fu grip, getcha roof split
Pull a piece on me, better use it nigga
You hit the lotto this time, cause I’ma do you dirty as shit
Even wit’ a rifle ya odds are still 30 to 6
You look nervous, that’s pussy shit, I gotta problem wit’ that
So I’ll have 'em pourin' out cat litter where ya body was at
Nigga who watchin ya back?
I say getcha city involved
I’ll show ‘em my countryside when I make Ru stick (rustic) to the wall
I son niggas...like ""I’m gettin tired a you missin' my calls
Where the fuck was you Father’s Day?""
Fuck around and get Marvin Gaye’d
Combination'll have this nigga lookin like Doctor Strange
His heart racin', STOP RUNNIN' IN MY HOUSE!
Made it stop racin’
Fuck Foster care and CPS, I’ll let God take him
Y’all basic
Straight trash get man one off a straight jab
Body shot
Have ‘em workin’ on his breathin’ like Lamaze class
Fuck uncle, I will bend ya wrist back until you say ""Dad""
You wanna die then I’m wit’ it
Only my time got a limit
Gon’ have me feelin' like a deadbeat by the time that I’m finished
'Cause they gon’ remember me for sonnin’ you, but they’ll have to remind me I did it
MadKing

Yo, my last opponent was funny as shit
So this is where your life change
I just battled a D.C. comic...then they give me Nitewing (Nightwing)
Bad plan
And just like DC Comics, I'mma have Nitewing (Nightwing) tryna get away from this bat, man (Batman)
WeGoHard, I got them (Gotham), City! I'm back, fam'!
He got bars? Highlight 'em, Jey (MJ): The Last Dance
Yo, Smack, man, these niggas is retarded, nigga!
Y'all put Nitewing against a nigga that clearly been robbin' (Robin) niggas
Your bitch sweet!
Samoan jawn, she 6'3""!
I'm 5'6"" - my monkey ass tryna climb that big tree!
She said, ""My boyfriend gon' be comin' home, swiftly.""
I'm not one to beg, I said, ""Bitch, please!""
She was off the shits, stretchin' her neck like an accordion
She tall as shit, gotta tippy-toe on the bed when I dog her shit
To make the story quick, she had to stop suckin' 'cause he called the bitch
So I stabbed that nigga over the head like a scorpion
What's wrong wit' him?
She at home watchin' this battle, enjoyin' it!
In su casa
Sittin' on the same couch that Samoan gave me dumb throat: Umaga!
ENOUGH'S ENOUGH!
You think 'cause I'm short, I won't FUCK YOU UP!?
We could knuckle up
I'll put the gun down, nigga...and shoot you wit' the other one!
I ain't fuckin' dumb!
Y'all niggas got it so wrong!
""Bando ain't gon' do shit 'cause bro small""
I ain't gotta do NOTHIN'!
I got mad niggas waitin' to let that chrome off!
It's Facebook: I could end y'all lives wit' a phone call!
Hold on!
I'm in your apartment, my nigga
I found wifey, but I couldn't find your moms or your sister
So I cut her up
Hit your breast, leg, thigh when I'm sparkin' the Smith n'
Put a drum on Wing...and a big box is where they find parts of your chicken
I'm so wit' the shits...if I lose, I'mma dump a grip
Shoot up the tournament: Above The Rim
What the fuck is this!?
Y'all got Bando on some other shit!
KFC menu: I got Wing on my bucket list!
That's Round 2, nigga...the fuck!?

Let's get serious, you know how stupid you been makin us look?
You got the fans talkin' 'bout us like we can’t even cook
N.O.M.E. Ten, and you one name away from the look
And on Rookies Vs Vets this nigga ain’t even booked
Cause they tired of yo' fuckin' ass
Name flips, you just button mash
But this ain’t (Saint) Patrick, more like the day after wit’ that lucky trash
It’s to the point, where even if I choke, you don’t fuckin' pass
Least wit' the judges decision, you done put the whole staff in a fucked up position
It’s already been mentioned
If I start chokin' I'm just lettin' you finish
And they just gon' come up wit’ an excuse on why they still had me winnin'
Like, ""Yeah Bando gave us three rounds, but Jey presence is different.""
I hope you payin' attention, cause now it’s mad overdue
Nobody gives a flyin' fuck that I’m battlin' you
Everyone who lost before deserves this more, even Honor and Pat didn’t lose
Sound like they talkin' 'bout 2020 when they ask about Ru
Cause wit’ all the real sick (Sikh) and the Chaos they’d still take that over you
So at this point, I’m just gonna save my fuckin' bars before I feel dumb
I got N.O.M.E. in two weeks, every clip I already filled 'em
He still tryna win I can’t tell, feel like he still done
My advice, put down all those gun bars, 'til you've held a real one
Cause I know this ain’t how Brooklyn do
Every time I look at chu, I wanna call Jaz to see if ya mother’s tryna look for you
My nigga you from Brooklyn Ru, where the fuck is ya pride?
You showin' up to every round lookin' like somebody died
Like 25 ain’t shit to you, you got some better shit to do?
What? You, like, 22?
Typical
These motherfuckin' millennials
I better hear you outside apologize durin’ ya interview
Tonight I’m better than you
Next time I expect better from you
Mad!

Yo!...
You tried to talk about the name flips?
Well, you don't choose the brightest of names
You play chess?
Then you should know, nigga
You can't checkmate a nigga wit' just a Nite (knight) and a King
You got some nerve, duke!
I got some Locs that let a bird shoot!
Fool's mate: it ain't nothin' they could do for King after my third move!
Now...
It ain't-!
It ain't nothin' they could do for King after my third move
Hold on, y'all

Kommer opp, jeg skal nok skinne
Har tatt noen L's men nå skal jeg vinne
Talentløse folk, tror de kan skinne
De ser på meg, later som de er så blinde
Har mange bangers, når skal jeg droppe?
Gucci og Prada er det skal jeg coppe
Spytter så fort, jeg kan ikke stoppe
Holder det ekte, jeg kan ikke floppe
Hør på barsa, er du i tvil?
Jeg er en ung spiller, jeg gjør som jeg vil
Du hater på meg, men jeg har jo grov stil
Du buer på meg, men jeg treffer som pil
Føler meg så lavish ja
Bitchen hun er baddest ah
Hopper av og på beaten som Blueface
Hater folk som alltid skal være two-faced
Har så mange flows, du blir amazed
Jeg er fortsatt stuck in a maze
Prøv å forstå, er on the low
Jeg skriver og spytter, og mekker no grovt
Legger inn rim, bringer inn flow
Jeg føler jeg bare må, få det ut nå
Tjener bare lægs, tar det med hjem
Barsa, så grove at ikke engang Scofield kan rømme fra dem

Sirkel full av sjefer, barsa bare dreper
Ville følge etter meg, jeg styre sauer som en gjeter
Bitchen din vet hva jeg heter, ville bli som Olai og fyre opp bønne som raketter, ville henge med poteten
Stilen flytter fjell, fikk den av meg selv
Har ikke noe rollemodell, jeg stoler bare på spenn som jeg blar opp, kanskje best for deg at du ga opp
Du trenger tid til å lade opp, jeg ber mæba di gape opp
Ikke tro jeg bare fakker
Henger ute på kanten
Byen full av kakerlakker
ODG det er banden
Baller ut på masse flex, Olai LB du vet det er mannen
Feil steg du ramler, hvis vi ser at du mangler

Vet du hva, vet du hva?
Jeg hørte hva du sa
Chatter piss bak min rygg
Fått nok, så ha det bra!
Kom inn i gamet nå nylig
Setter no spor og de er så tydlig
Tankene spinner så fort som en frisbee
Du er A4, jeg tenker langsiktig
Verden er fake, trenger en break
Flowen min flower som en fuckings lake
Trekker fra grammern og føler meg baked
Så hva synes du da, mate?
Trekker fra jizzern og føler meg fri g
Du passer kassa på Rimi, trist liv, min stil er å tæppe din mæbe og datter samtidig
Har mista nok tid på å høre på dritt
Frister no jævlig i kjøre til døra du bitch, kan lett bli en krig når det fritt fram, mekker en morna med Rick mann

Mekker en morna med Rick

Jeg og gutta går i Fast Lane
Leter etter no med null pain
Skru opp lyden på maks gain
LB, mekker, det er insane
Leverer bars som et postbud
Hørte sangen, du er lost dude
Banker deg opp, det blir ""bæbu""
Minner meg mer om en feit ku!
Du waster tusen på shoes
Jeg waster fire på Goose
Du waster tjue på brus
Jeg waster tusen på booze
Jeg må nok holde et kurs, hvordan å holde seg rust
Drømmene dine blir knust, ikke mekk bars som er duf

Telefon mi zvoni i zvoni, Brane je pilot, gluva je kokpit

MS
LAURYN
HILL
Letter Of Recognition-
Firstly, I want to thank everyone who wrote letters and sent packages and books. Because of you there was not one day that I didn't receive mail while I was away. I appreciated that. Also, know that many of your letters not only touched me but continued to confirm for me what I already knew but needed to hear again: that sincere expression has a serious purpose. If one of you had been touched, picked up, encouraged, prevented from succumbing to some measure of social or Spiritual decline, then it was worth it. Folks, walk strong, seek light and Universal correction in all things. Know that man-made concerns and Universal concerns are not always in agreement. Obviously, strive to please God. Thank you again and again.
In Love and Freedom,
Ms. Lauryn Hill

'Cause I'm beggin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

Ridin' high, when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you want me then
But easy come and easy go
And it would end
So, any time I need ya, let me go
Yah, any time I feed you, get me? No
Any time I see you, let me know
But I planted that seed, just let me grow
I'm on my knees while I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't want to lose you
Hey yeah, ratatata

I'm beggin', beggin' you
And put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
And put your loving hand out, darlin'

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again
An empty shell
I used to be
The shadow of my life
Was hangin' over me
A broken man
But I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance
To win my soul

What we doin'? What we chasin'?
What about 'em, why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You on a runway track from the good
I want to paint in the pictures any way we could, react
Like the heart in a trash where you should
You done gave it away, ya' had it till you took it back
But I keep walkin' on
Keep rockin' dawns
Keep walking forward
Now the court is yours
Keep browsin' halls
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
Girl I'm beggin'

Mhh ye-e-e-ah
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

I'm fightin' hard
To hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holdin' on
I can't fall back
I'm just a con about to fade to black

I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby

I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some black, I ain't mean black (And pray to the God)
I want everything black (We don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black

Six in the morn'
Fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)
That's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)
Black don't crack, my nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon
Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
That I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listen then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score

The question is under what circumstances the distributor of a product capable of both lawful and unlawful use is liable for acts of copyright infringement by third parties using the product. We hold that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.
I.A.  Respondents, Grokster, Ltd., and StreamCast Networks, Inc., defendants in the trial court, distribute free software products that allow computer users to share electronic files through peer-to-peer networks, so called because users' computers communicate directly with each other, not through central servers. The advantage of peer-to-peer networks over information networks of other types shows up in their substantial and growing popularity. Because they need no central computer server to mediate the exchange of information or files among users, the high-bandwidth communications capacity for a server may be dispensed with, and the need for costly server storage space is eliminated. Since copies of a file (particularly a popular one) are available on many users' computers, file requests and retrievals may be faster than on other types of networks, and since file exchanges do not travel through a server, communications can take place between any computers that remain connected to the network without risk that a glitch in the server will disable the network in its entirety. Given these benefits in security, cost, and efficiency, peer-to-peer networks are employed to store and distribute electronic files by universities, government agencies, corporations, and libraries, among others.
Other users of peer-to-peer networks include individual recipients of Grokster's and StreamCast's software, and although the networks that they enjoy through using the software can be used to share any type of digital file, they have prominently employed those networks in sharing copyrighted music and video files without authorization. A group of copyright holders (MGM for short, but including motion picture studios, recording companies, songwriters, and music publishers) sued Grokster and StreamCast for their users' copyright infringements, alleging that they knowingly and intentionally distributed their software to enable users to reproduce and distribute the copyrighted works in violation of the Copyright Act, 17 U. S. C. § 101 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. II). MGM sought damages and an injunction.
Discovery during the litigation revealed the way the software worked, the business aims of each defendant company, and the predilections of the users. Grokster's eponymous software employs what is known as FastTrack technology, a protocol developed by others and licensed to Grokster. StreamCast distributes a very similar product except that its software, called Morpheus, relies on what is known as Gnutella technology. A user who downloads and installs either software possesses the protocol to send requests for files directly to the computers of others using software compatible with FastTrack or Gnutella. On the FastTrack network opened by the Grokster software, the user's request goes to a computer given an indexing capacity by the software and designated a supernode, or to some other computer with comparable power and capacity to collect temporary indexes of the files available on the computers of users connected to it. The supernode (or indexing computer) searches its own index and may communicate the search request to other supernodes. If the file is found, the supernode discloses its location to the computer requesting it, and the requesting user can download the file directly from the computer located. The copied file is placed in a designated sharing folder on the requesting user's computer, where it is available for other users to download in turn, along with any other file in that folder.
In the Gnutella network made available by Morpheus, the process is mostly the same, except that in some versions of the Gnutella protocol there are no supernodes. In these versions, peer computers using the protocol communicate directly with each other. When a user enters a search request into the Morpheus software, it sends the request to computers connected with it, which in turn pass the request along to other connected peers. The search results are communicated to the requesting computer, and the user can download desired files directly from peers' computers. As this description indicates, Grokster and StreamCast use no servers to intercept the content of the search requests or to mediate the file transfers conducted by users of the software, there being no central point through which the substance of the communications passes in either direction.
Although Grokster and StreamCast do not therefore know when particular files are copied, a few searches using their software would show what is available on the networks the software reaches. MGM commissioned a statistician to conduct a systematic search, and his study showed that nearly 90% of the files available for download on the FastTrack system were copyrighted works.  Grokster and StreamCast dispute this figure, raising methodological problems and arguing that free copying even of copyrighted works may be authorized by the rightholders. They also argue that potential noninfringing uses of their software are significant in kind, even if infrequent in practice. Some musical performers, for example, have gained new audiences by distributing  their copyrighted works for free across peer-to-peer networks, and some distributors of unprotected content have used peer-to-peer networks to disseminate files, Shakespeare being an example. Indeed, StreamCast has given Morpheus users the opportunity to download the briefs in this very case, though their popularity has not been quantified.
As for quantification, the parties' anecdotal and statistical evidence entered thus far to show the content available on the FastTrack and Gnutella networks does not say much about which files are actually downloaded by users, and no one can say how often the software is used to obtain copies of unprotected material. But MGM's evidence gives reason to think that the vast majority of users' downloads are acts of infringement, and because well over 100 million copies of the software in question are known to have been downloaded, and billions of files are shared across the FastTrack and Gnutella networks each month, the probable scope of copyright infringement is staggering.
Grokster and StreamCast concede the infringement in most downloads, Brief for Respondents 10, n. 6, and it is uncontested that they are aware that users employ their software primarily to download copyrighted files, even if the decentralized FastTrack and Gnutella networks fail to reveal which files are being copied, and when. From time to time, moreover, the companies have learned about their users' infringement directly, as from users who have sent e-mail to each company with questions about playing copyrighted movies they had downloaded, to whom the companies have responded with guidance. App. 559-563, 808-816, 939-954. And MGM notified the companies of 8 million copyrighted files that could be obtained using their software.
Grokster and StreamCast are not, however, merely passive recipients of information about infringing use. The record is replete with evidence that from the moment Grokster and StreamCast began to distribute their free software, each one clearly voiced the objective that recipients use it to download copyrighted works, and each took active steps to encourage infringement.
After the notorious file-sharing service, Napster, was sued by copyright holders for facilitation of copyright infringement, A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 2d 896 (ND Cal. 2000), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), StreamCast gave away a software program of a kind known as OpenNap, designed as compatible with the Napster program and open to Napster users for downloading files from other Napster and OpenNap users' computers. Evidence indicates that ""t was always  intent to use  to be able to capture email addresses of  initial target market so that  could promote  StreamCast Morpheus interface to them,"" App. 861; indeed, the OpenNap program was engineered ""`to leverage Napster's 50 million user base,'"" id., at 746.
StreamCast monitored both the number of users downloading its OpenNap program and the number of music files they downloaded. Id., at 859, 863, 866. It also used the resulting OpenNap network to distribute copies of the Morpheus software and to encourage users to adopt it. Id., at 861, 867, 1039. Internal company documents indicate that StreamCast hoped to attract large numbers of former Napster users if that company was shut down by court order or otherwise, and that StreamCast planned to be the next Napster. Id., at 861. A kit developed by StreamCast to be delivered to advertisers, for example, contained press articles about StreamCast's potential to capture former Napster users, id., at 568-572, and it introduced itself to some potential advertisers as a company ""which is similar to what Napster was,"" id., at 884. It broadcast banner advertisements to users of other Napster-compatible software, urging them to adopt its OpenNap. Id., at 586. An internal e-mail from a company executive stated: ""`We have put this network in 925*925 place so that when Napster pulls the plug on their free service . . . or if the Court orders them shut down prior to that . . . we will be positioned to capture the flood of their 32 million users that will be actively looking for an alternative.'"" Id., at 588-589, 861.
Thus, StreamCast developed promotional materials to market its service as the best Napster alternative. One proposed advertisement read: ""Napster Inc. has announced that it will soon begin charging you a fee. That's if the courts don't order it shut down first. What will you do to get around it?"" Id., at 897. Another proposed ad touted StreamCast's software as the ""#1 alternative to Napster"" and asked ""hen the lights went off at Napster . . . where did the users go?"" Id., at 836 (ellipsis in original). StreamCast even planned to flaunt the illegal uses of its software; when it launched the OpenNap network, the chief technology officer of the company averred that ""he goal is to get in trouble with the law and get sued. It's the best way to get in the new."" Id., at 916.
The evidence that Grokster sought to capture the market of former Napster users is sparser but revealing, for Grokster launched its own OpenNap system called Swaptor and inserted digital codes into its Web site so that computer users using Web search engines to look for ""Napster"" or ""ree file sharing"" would be directed to the Grokster Web site, where they could download the Grokster software. Id., at 992-993. And Grokster's name is an apparent derivative of Napster.
StreamCast's executives monitored the number of songs by certain commercial artists available on their networks, and an internal communication indicates they aimed to have a larger number of copyrighted songs available on their networks than other file-sharing networks. Id., at 868. The point, of course, would be to attract users of a mind to infringe, just as it would be with their promotional materials developed showing copyrighted songs as examples of the kinds of files available through Morpheus. Id., at 848. Morpheus in fact allowed users to search specifically for ""Top 40"" songs, id., at 735, which were inevitably copyrighted. Similarly, Grokster sent users a newsletter promoting its ability to provide particular, popular copyrighted materials. Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 7-8.
In addition to this evidence of express promotion, marketing, and intent to promote further, the business models employed by Grokster and StreamCast confirm that their principal object was use of their software to download copyrighted works. Grokster and StreamCast receive no revenue from users, who obtain the software itself for nothing. Instead, both companies generate income by selling advertising space, and they stream the advertising to Grokster and Morpheus users while they are employing the programs. As the number of users of each program increases, advertising opportunities become worth more. Cf. App. 539, 804. While there is doubtless some demand for free Shakespeare, the evidence shows that substantive volume is a function of free access to copyrighted work. Users seeking Top 40 songs, for example, or the latest release by Modest Mouse, are certain to be far more numerous than those seeking a free Decameron, and Grokster and StreamCast translated that demand into dollars.
Finally, there is no evidence that either company made an effort to filter copyrighted material from users' downloads or otherwise impede the sharing of copyrighted files. Although Grokster appears to have sent e-mails warning users about infringing content when it received threatening notice from the copyright holders, it never blocked anyone from continuing to use its software to share copyrighted files. Id., at 75-76. StreamCast not only rejected another company's offer of help to monitor infringement, id., at 928-929, but blocked the Internet Protocol addresses of entities it believed were trying to engage in such monitoring on its networks, id., at 917-922.
B.  After discovery, the parties on each side of the case crossmoved for summary judgment. The District Court limited its consideration to the asserted liability of Grokster and StreamCast for distributing the current versions of their software, leaving aside whether either was liable ""for damages arising from past versions of their software, or from other past activities."" 259 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 1033 (CD Cal. 2003). The District Court held that those who used the Grokster and Morpheus software to download copyrighted media files directly infringed MGM's copyrights, a conclusion not contested on appeal, but the court nonetheless granted summary judgment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast as to any liability arising from distribution of the then-current versions of their software. Distributing that software gave rise to no liability in the court's view, because its use did not provide the distributors with actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement. Case No. CV 01 08541 SVW (PJWx) (CD Cal., June 18, 2003), App. 1213.
The Court of Appeals affirmed. 380 F. 3d 1154 (CA9 2004). In the court's analysis, a defendant was liable as a contributory infringer when it had knowledge of direct infringement and materially contributed to the infringement. But the court read Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417 (1984), as holding that distribution of a commercial product capable of substantial noninfringing uses could not give rise to contributory liability for infringement unless the distributor had actual knowledge of specific instances of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge. The fact that the software was capable of substantial noninfringing uses in the Ninth Circuit's view meant that Grokster and StreamCast were not liable, because they had no such actual knowledge, owing to the decentralized architecture of their software. The court also held that Grokster and StreamCast did not materially contribute to their users' infringement because it was the users themselves who searched for, retrieved, and stored the infringing files, with no involvement by the defendants beyond providing the software in the first place.
The Ninth Circuit also considered whether Grokster and StreamCast could be liable under a theory of vicarious infringement. The court held against liability because the defendants did not monitor or control the use of the software, had no agreed-upon right or current ability to supervise its use, and had no independent duty to police infringement. We granted certiorari. 543 U. S. 1032 (2004).
II.  A.  MGM and many of the amici fault the Court of Appeals's holding for upsetting a sound balance between the respective values of supporting creative pursuits through copyright protection and promoting innovation in new communication technologies by limiting the incidence of liability for copyright infringement. The more artistic protection is favored, the more technological innovation may be discouraged; the administration of copyright law is an exercise in managing the tradeoff. See Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, supra, at 442; see generally Ginsburg, Copyright and Control Over New Technologies of Dissemination, 101 Colum. L. Rev. 1613 (2001); Lichtman & Landes, Indirect Liability for Copyright Infringement: An Economic Perspective, 16 Harv. J. L. & Tech. 395 (2003).
The tension between the two values is the subject of this case, with its claim that digital distribution of copyrighted material threatens copyright holders as never before, because every copy is identical to the original, copying is easy, and many people (especially the young) use file-sharing software to download copyrighted works. This very breadth of the software's use may well draw the public directly into the debate over copyright policy, Peters, Brace Memorial Lecture: Copyright Enters the Public Domain, 51 J. Copyright Soc. 701, 705-717 (2004) (address by Register of Copyrights), and the indications are that the ease of copying songs or movies using software like Grokster's and Napster's is fostering disdain for copyright protection, Wu, When Code Isn't Law, 89 Va. L. Rev. 679, 724-726 (2003). As the case has been presented to us, these fears are said to be offset by the different concern that imposing liability, not only on infringers but on distributors of software based on its potential for unlawful use, could limit further development of beneficial technologies. See, e. g., Lemley & Reese, Reducing Digital Copyright Infringement Without Restricting Innovation, 56 Stan. L. Rev. 1345, 1386-1390 (2004); Brief for Innovation Scholars and Economists as Amici Curiae 15-20; Brief for Emerging Technology Companies as Amici Curiae 19-25; Brief for Intel Corporation as Amicus Curiae 20-22.
The argument for imposing indirect liability in this case is, however, a powerful one, given the number of infringing downloads that occur every day using StreamCast's and Grokster's software. When a widely shared service or product is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible to enforce rights in the protected work effectively against all direct infringers, the only practical alternative being to go against the distributor of the copying device for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicarious infringement. See In re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334 F. 3d 643, 645-646 (CA7 2003).
One infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement, see Gershwin Pub. Corp. v. Columbia Artists Management, Inc., 443 F. 2d 1159, 1162 (CA2 1971), and infringes vicariously by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise a right to stop or limit it, Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. v. H. L. Green Co., 316 F. 2d 304, 307 (CA2 1963). Although ""he Copyright Act does not expressly render anyone liable for infringement committed by another,"" Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, 464 U. S., at 434, these doctrines of secondary liability emerged from common law principles and are well established in the law, id., at 486 (Blackmun, J., dissenting); Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers, 222 U. S. 55, 62-63 (1911); Gershwin Pub. Corp. v. Columbia Artists Management, 931*931 supra, at 1162; 3 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Copyright § 12.04 (2005).
B.  Despite the currency of these principles of secondary liability, this Court has dealt with secondary copyright infringement in only one recent case, and because MGM has tailored its principal claim to our opinion there, a look at our earlier holding is in order. In Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, supra, this Court addressed a claim that secondary liability for infringement can arise from the very distribution of a commercial product. There, the product, novel at the time, was what we know today as the videocassette recorder or VCR. Copyright holders sued Sony as the manufacturer, claiming it was contributorily liable for infringement that occurred when VCR owners taped copyrighted programs because it supplied the means used to infringe, and it had constructive knowledge that infringement would occur. At the trial on the merits, the evidence showed that the principal use of the VCR was for ""`time-shifting,'"" or taping a program for later viewing at a more convenient time, which the Court found to be a fair, not an infringing, use. Id., at 423-424. There was no evidence that Sony had expressed an object of bringing about taping in violation of copyright or had taken active steps to increase its profits from unlawful taping. Id., at 438. Although Sony's advertisements urged consumers to buy the VCR to ""`record favorite shows'"" or ""`build a library'"" of recorded programs, id., at 459 (Blackmun, J., dissenting), neither of these uses was necessarily infringing, id., at 424, 454-455.
On those facts, with no evidence of stated or indicated intent to promote infringing uses, the only conceivable basis for imposing liability was on a theory of contributory infringement arising from its sale of VCRs to consumers with knowledge that some would use them to infringe. Id., at 439. But because the VCR was ""capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses,"" we held the manufacturer could not be faulted solely on the basis of its distribution. Id., at 442.
This analysis reflected patent law's traditional staple article of commerce doctrine, now codified, that distribution of a component of a patented device will not violate the patent if it is suitable for use in other ways. 35 U. S. C. § 271(c); Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U. S. 476, 485 (1964) (noting codification of cases); id., at 486, n. 6 (same). The doctrine was devised to identify instances in which it may be presumed from distribution of an article in commerce that the distributor intended the article to be used to infringe another's patent, and so may justly be held liable for that infringement. ""One who makes and sells articles which are only adapted to be used in a patented combination will be presumed to intend the natural consequences of his acts; he will be presumed to intend that they shall be used in the combination of the patent."" New York Scaffolding Co. v. Whitney, 224 F. 452, 459 (CA8 1915); see also James Heekin Co. v. Baker, 138 F. 63, 66 (CA8 1905); Canda v. Michigan Malleable Iron Co., 124 F. 486, 489 (CA6 1903); Thomson-Houston Electric Co. v. Ohio Brass Co., 80 F. 712, 720-721 (CA6 1897); Red Jacket Mfg. Co. v. Davis, 82 F. 432, 439 (CA7 1897); Holly v. Vergennes Machine Co., 4 F. 74, 82 (CC Vt. 1880); Renwick v. Pond, 20 F. Cas. 536, 541 (No. 11,702) (CC SDNY 1872).
In sum, where an article is ""good for nothing else"" but infringement, Canda v. Michigan Malleable Iron Co., supra, at 489, there is no legitimate public interest in its unlicensed availability, and there is no injustice in presuming or imputing an intent to infringe, see Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1, 48 (1912), overruled on other grounds, Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U. S. 502 (1917). Conversely, the doctrine absolves the equivocal conduct of selling an item with substantial lawful as well as unlawful uses, and limits liability to instances of more acute fault than the mere understanding that some of one's products will be misused. It leaves breathing room for innovation and a vigorous commerce. See Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, 464 U. S., at 442; Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co., 448 U. S. 176, 221 (1980); Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., supra, at 48.
The parties and many of the amici in this case think the key to resolving it is the Sony rule and, in particular, what it means for a product to be ""capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses."" Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, supra, at 442. MGM advances the argument that granting summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast as to their current activities gave too much weight to the value of innovative technology, and too little to the copyrights infringed by users of their software, given that 90% of works available on one of the networks was shown to be copyrighted. Assuming the remaining 10% to be its noninfringing use, MGM says this should not qualify as ""substantial,"" and the Court should quantify Sony to the extent of holding that a product used ""principally"" for infringement does not qualify. See Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 31. As mentioned before, Grokster and StreamCast reply by citing evidence that their software can be used to reproduce public domain works, and they point to copyright holders who actually encourage copying. Even if infringement is the principal practice with their software today, they argue, the noninfringing uses are significant and will grow.
We agree with MGM that the Court of Appeals misapplied Sony, which it read as limiting secondary liability quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied. Sony barred secondary liability based on presuming or imputing intent to cause infringement solely from the design or distribution of a product capable of substantial lawful use, which the distributor knows is in fact used for infringement. The Ninth Circuit has read Sony's limitation to mean that whenever a product is capable of substantial lawful use, the producer can never be held contributorily liable for third parties' infringing use of it; it read the rule as being this broad, even when an actual purpose to cause infringing use is shown by evidence independent of design and distribution of the product, unless the distributors had ""specific knowledge of infringement at a time at which they contributed to the infringement, and failed to act upon that information."" 380 F. 3d, at 1162 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Because the Circuit found the StreamCast and Grokster software capable of substantial lawful use, it concluded on the basis of its reading of Sony that neither company could be held liable, since there was no showing that their software, being without any central server, afforded them knowledge of specific unlawful uses.
This view of Sony, however, was error, converting the case from one about liability resting on imputed intent to one about liability on any theory. Because Sony did not displace other theories of secondary liability, and because we find below that it was error to grant summary judgment to the companies on MGM's inducement claim, we do not revisit Sony further, as MGM requests, to add a more quantified description of the point of balance between protection and commerce when liability rests solely on distribution with knowledge that unlawful use will occur. It is enough to note that the Ninth Circuit's judgment rested on an erroneous understanding of Sony and to leave further consideration of the Sony rule for a day when that may be required.
C.  Sony's rule limits imputing culpable intent as a matter of law from the characteristics or uses of a distributed product. But nothing in Sony requires courts to ignore evidence of intent if there is such evidence, and the case was never meant to foreclose rules of fault-based liability derived from the common law. Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, supra, at 439 (""If vicarious liability is to be imposed on Sony in this case, it must rest on the fact that it has sold equipment with constructive knowledge"" of the potential for infringement). Thus, where evidence goes beyond a product's characteristics or the knowledge that it may be put to infringing uses, and shows statements or actions directed to promoting infringement, Sony's staple-article rule will not preclude liability.
The classic case of direct evidence of unlawful purpose occurs when one induces commission of infringement by another, or ""entic or persuad another"" to infringe, Black's Law Dictionary 790 (8th ed. 2004), as by advertising. Thus at common law a copyright or patent defendant who ""not only expected but invoked  by advertisement"" was liable for infringement ""on principles recognized in every part of the law."" Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers, 222 U. S., at 62-63 (copyright infringement). See also Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S., at 48-49 (contributory liability for patent infringement may be found where a good's ""most conspicuous use is one which will coöperate in an infringement when sale to such user is invoked by advertisement"" of the infringing use); Thomson-Houston Electric Co. v. Kelsey Electric R. Specialty Co., 75 F. 1005, 1007-1008 (CA2 1896) (relying on advertisements and displays to find defendant's ""willingness . . . to aid other persons in any attempts which they may be disposed to make towards  infringement""); Rumford Chemical Works v. Hecker, 20 F. Cas. 1342, 1346 (No. 12,133) (CC NJ 1876) (demonstrations of infringing activity along with ""avowals of the  purpose and use for which it was made"" supported liability for patent infringement).
The rule on inducement of infringement as developed in the early cases is no different today. Evidence of ""active steps . . . taken to encourage direct infringement,"" Oak Industries, Inc. v. Zenith Electronics Corp., 697 F. Supp. 988, 992 (ND Ill. 1988), such as advertising an infringing use or instructing how to engage in an infringing use, show an affirmative intent that the product be used to infringe, and a showing that infringement was encouraged overcomes the law's reluctance to find liability when a defendant merely sells a commercial product suitable for some lawful use, see, e. g., Water Technologies Corp. v. Calco, Ltd., 850 F. 2d 660, 668 (CA Fed. 1988) (liability for inducement where one ""actively and knowingly aid and abet another's direct infringement"" (emphasis deleted)); Fromberg, Inc. v. Thornhill, 315 F. 2d 407, 412-413 (CA5 1963) (demonstrations by sales staff of infringing uses supported liability for inducement); Haworth Inc. v. Herman Miller Inc., 37 USPQ 2d 1080, 1090 (WD Mich. 1994) (evidence that defendant ""demonstrate and recommend infringing configurations"" of its product could support inducement liability); Sims v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 459 F. Supp. 1198, 1215 (ED Pa. 1978) (finding inducement where the use ""depicted by the defendant in its promotional film and brochures infringes the . . . patent""), overruled on other grounds, 608 F. 2d 87 (CA3 1979). Cf. W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 37 (5th ed. 1984) (""There is a definite tendency to impose greater responsibility upon a defendant whose conduct was intended to do harm, or was morally wrong"").
For the same reasons that Sony took the staple-article doctrine of patent law as a model for its copyright safe-harbor rule, the inducement rule, too, is a sensible one for copyright. We adopt it here, holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties. We are, of course, mindful of the need to keep from trenching on regular commerce or discouraging the development of technologies with lawful and unlawful potential. Accordingly, just as Sony did not find intentional inducement despite the knowledge of the VCR manufacturer that its device could be used to infringe, 464 U. S., at 439, n. 19, mere knowledge of infringing potential or of actual infringing uses would not be enough here to subject a distributor to liability. Nor would ordinary acts incident to product distribution, such as offering customers technical support or product updates, support liability in themselves. The inducement rule, instead, premises liability on purposeful, culpable expression and conduct, and thus does nothing to compromise legitimate commerce or discourage innovation having a lawful promise.
III.  A.  The only apparent question about treating MGM's evidence as sufficient to withstand summary judgment under the theory of inducement goes to the need on MGM's part to adduce evidence that StreamCast and Grokster communicated an inducing message to their software users. The classic instance of inducement is by advertisement or solicitation that broadcasts a message designed to stimulate others to commit violations. MGM claims that such a message is shown here. It is undisputed that StreamCast beamed onto the computer screens of users of Napster-compatible programs ads urging the adoption of its OpenNap program, which was designed, as its name implied, to invite the custom of patrons of Napster, then under attack in the courts for facilitating massive infringement. Those who accepted StreamCast's OpenNap program were offered software to perform the same services, which a factfinder could conclude would readily have been understood in the Napster market as the ability to download copyrighted music files. Grokster distributed an electronic newsletter containing links to articles promoting its software's ability to access popular copyrighted music. And anyone whose Napster or free file-sharing searches turned up a link to Grokster would have understood Grokster to be offering the same file-sharing ability as Napster, and to the same people who probably used Napster for infringing downloads; that would also have been the understanding of anyone offered Grokster's suggestively named Swaptor software, its version of OpenNap. And both companies communicated a clear message by responding affirmatively to requests for help in locating and playing copyrighted materials.
In StreamCast's case, of course, the evidence just described was supplemented by other unequivocal indications of unlawful purpose in the internal communications and advertising designs aimed at Napster users (""When the lights went off at Napster . . . where did the users go?"" App. 836 (ellipsis in original)). Whether the messages were communicated is not to the point on this record. The function of the message in the theory of inducement is to prove by a defendant's own statements that his unlawful purpose disqualifies him from claiming protection (and incidentally to point to actual violators likely to be found among those who hear or read the message). See supra, at 935-937. Proving that a message was sent out, then, is the preeminent but not exclusive way of showing that active steps were taken with the purpose of bringing about infringing acts, and of showing that infringing acts took place by using the device distributed. Here, the summary judgment record is replete with other evidence that Grokster and StreamCast, unlike the manufacturer and distributor in Sony, acted with a purpose to cause copyright violations by use of software suitable for illegal use. See supra, at 924-927.
Three features of this evidence of intent are particularly notable. First, each company showed itself to be aiming to satisfy a known source of demand for copyright infringement, the market comprising former Napster users. StreamCast's internal documents made constant reference to Napster, it initially distributed its Morpheus software through an OpenNap program compatible with Napster, it advertised its OpenNap program to Napster users, and its Morpheus software functions as Napster did except that it could be used to distribute more kinds of files, including copyrighted movies and software programs. Grokster's name is apparently derived from Napster, it too initially offered an OpenNap program, its software's function is likewise comparable to Napster's, and it attempted to divert queries for Napster onto its own Web site. Grokster and StreamCast's efforts to supply services to former Napster users, deprived of a mechanism to copy and distribute what were overwhelmingly infringing files, indicate a principal, if not exclusive, intent on the part of each to bring about infringement.
Second, this evidence of unlawful objective is given added significance by MGM's showing that neither company attempted to develop filtering tools or other mechanisms to diminish the infringing activity using their software. While the Ninth Circuit treated the defendants' failure to develop such tools as irrelevant because they lacked an independent duty to monitor their users' activity, we think this evidence underscores Grokster's and StreamCast's intentional facilitation of their users' infringement.
Third, there is a further complement to the direct evidence of unlawful objective. It is useful to recall that StreamCast and Grokster make money by selling advertising space, by directing ads to the screens of computers employing their software. As the record shows, the more the software is used, the more ads are sent out and the greater the advertising revenue becomes. Since the extent of the software's use determines the gain to the distributors, the commercial sense of their enterprise turns on high-volume use, which the record shows is infringing. This evidence alone would not justify an inference of unlawful intent, but viewed in the context of the entire record its import is clear.
The unlawful objective is unmistakable.
B.  In addition to intent to bring about infringement and distribution of a device suitable for infringing use, the inducement theory of course requires evidence of actual infringement by recipients of the device, the software in this case. As the account of the facts indicates, there is evidence of infringement on a gigantic scale, and there is no serious issue of the adequacy of MGM's showing on this point in order to survive the companies' summary judgment requests. Although an exact calculation of infringing use, as a basis for a claim of damages, is subject to dispute, there is no question that the summary judgment evidence is at least adequate to entitle MGM to go forward with claims for damages and equitable relief.
* * *
In sum, this case is significantly different from Sony and reliance on that case to rule in favor of StreamCast and Grokster was error. Sony dealt with a claim of liability based solely on distributing a product with alternative lawful and unlawful uses, with knowledge that some users would follow the unlawful course. The case struck a balance between the interests of protection and innovation by holding that the product's capability of substantial lawful employment should bar the imputation of fault and consequent secondary liability for the unlawful acts of others.
MGM's evidence in this case most obviously addresses a different basis of liability for distributing a product open to alternative uses. Here, evidence of the distributors' words and deeds going beyond distribution as such shows a purpose to cause and profit from third-party acts of copyright infringement. If liability for inducing infringement is ultimately found, it will not be on the basis of presuming or imputing fault, but from inferring a patently illegal objective from statements and actions showing what that objective was.
There is substantial evidence in MGM's favor on all elements of inducement, and summary judgment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast was error. On remand, reconsideration of MGM's motion for summary judgment will be in order.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE KENNEDY join, concurring.
I concur in the Court's decision, which vacates in full the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, ante, at 941, and write separately to clarify why I conclude that the Court of Appeals misperceived, and hence misapplied, our holding in Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417 (1984). There is here at least a ""genuine issue as to  material fact,"" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c), on the liability of Grokster or StreamCast, not only for actively inducing copyright infringement, but also, or alternatively, based on the distribution of their software products, for contributory copyright infringement. On neither score was summary judgment for Grokster and StreamCast warranted.
At bottom, however labeled, the question in this case is whether Grokster and StreamCast are liable for the direct infringing acts of others. Liability under our jurisprudence may be predicated on actively encouraging (or inducing) infringement through specific acts (as the Court's opinion develops) or on distributing a product distributees use to infringe copyrights, if the product is not capable of ""substantial"" or ""commercially significant"" noninfringing uses. Sony, 464 U. S., at 442; see also 3 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 12.04 (2005). While the two categories overlap, they capture different culpable behavior. Long coexisting, both are now codified in patent law. Compare 35 U. S. C. § 271(b) (active inducement liability) with § 271(c) (contributory liability for distribution of a product not ""suitable for substantial noninfringing use"").
In Sony, 464 U. S. 417, the Court considered Sony's liability for selling the Betamax videocassette recorder. It did so enlightened by a full trial record. Drawing an analogy to the staple article of commerce doctrine from patent law, the Sony Court observed that the ""sale of an article . . . adapted to  infringing use"" does not suffice ""to make the seller a contributory infringer"" if the article ""is also adapted to other and lawful uses."" Id., at 441 (quoting Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1, 48 (1912), overruled on other grounds, Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U. S. 502, 517 (1917)).
""The staple article of commerce doctrine"" applied to copyright, the Court stated, ""must strike a balance between a copyright holder's legitimate demand for effective—not merely symbolic—protection of the statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce."" Sony, 464 U. S., at 442. ""Accordingly,"" the Court held, ""the sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses."" Ibid. Thus, to resolve the Sony case, the Court explained, it had to determine ""whether the Betamax is capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses."" Ibid.
To answer that question, the Court considered whether ""a significant number of  noninfringing."" Ibid. The Court homed in on one potential use—private, noncommercial time-shifting of television programs in the home (i. e., recording a broadcast TV program for later personal viewing). Time-shifting was noninfringing, the Court concluded, because in some cases trial testimony showed it was authorized by the copyright holder, id., at 443-447, and in others it qualified as legitimate fair use, id., at 447-455. Most purchasers used the Betamax principally to engage in time-shifting, id., at 421, 423, a use that ""plainly satisfie"" the Court's standard, id., at 442. Thus, there was no need in Sony to ""give precise content to the question of how much  use is commercially significant."" Ibid. Further development was left for later days and cases.
The Ninth Circuit went astray, I will endeavor to explain, when that court granted summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast on the charge of contributory liability based on distribution of their software products. Relying on its earlier opinion in A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), the Court of Appeals held that ""if substantial noninfringing use was shown, the copyright owner would be required to show that the defendant had reasonable knowledge of specific infringing files."" 380 F. 3d 1154, 1161 (CA9 2004). ""A careful examination of the record,"" the court concluded, ""indicates that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to noninfringing use."" Ibid. The appeals court pointed to the band Wilco, which made one of its albums available for free downloading, to other recording artists who may have authorized free distribution of their music through the Internet, and to public domain literary works and films available through Grokster's and StreamCast's software. Ibid. Although it acknowledged petitioners' (hereinafter MGM) assertion that ""the vast majority of the software use is for copyright infringement,"" the court concluded that Grokster's and StreamCast's proffered evidence met Sony's requirement that ""a product need only be capable of substantial noninfringing uses."" 380 F. 3d, at 1162.
This case differs markedly from Sony. Cf. Peters, Brace Memorial Lecture: Copyright Enters the Public Domain, 51 J. Copyright Soc. 701, 724 (2004) (""The Grokster panel's reading of Sony is the broadest that any court has given it . . . .""). Here, there has been no finding of any fair use and little beyond anecdotal evidence of noninfringing uses. In finding the Grokster and StreamCast software products capable of substantial noninfringing uses, the District Court and the Court of Appeals appear to have relied largely on declarations submitted by the defendants. These declarations include assertions (some of them hearsay) that a number of copyright owners authorize distribution of their works on the Internet and that some public domain material is available through peer-to-peer networks including those accessed through Grokster's and StreamCast's software. 380 F. 3d, at 1161; 259 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 1035-1036 (CD Cal. 2003); App. 125-171.
The District Court declared it ""undisputed that there are substantial noninfringing uses for Defendants' software,"" thus obviating the need for further proceedings. 259 F. Supp. 2d, at 1035. This conclusion appears to rest almost entirely on the collection of declarations submitted by Grokster and StreamCast. Ibid. Review of these declarations reveals mostly anecdotal evidence, sometimes obtained secondhand, of authorized copyrighted works or public domain works available online and shared through peer-to-peer networks, and general statements about the benefits of peer-to-peer technology. See, e. g., Decl. of Janis Ian ¶ 13, App. 128 (""P2P technologies offer musicians an alternative channel for promotion and distribution.""); Decl. of Gregory Newby ¶ 12, id., at 136 (""Numerous authorized and public domain Project Gutenberg eBooks are made available on Morpheus, Kazaa, Gnutella, Grokster, and similar software products.""); Decl. of Aram Sinnreich ¶ 6, id., at 151 (""file sharing seems to have a net positive impact on music sales""); Decl. of John Busher ¶ 8, id., at 166 (""I estimate that Acoustica generates sales of between $1,000 and $10,000 per month as a result of the distribution of its trialware software through the Gnutella and FastTrack Networks.""); Decl. of Patricia D. Hoekman ¶¶ 3-4, id., at 169-170 (search on Morpheus for ""President Bush speeches"" found several video recordings, searches for ""Declaration of Independence"" and ""Bible"" found various documents and declarant was able to download a copy of the Declaration); Decl. of Sean L. Mayers ¶ 11, id., at 67 (""Existing open, decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing networks . . . offer content owners distinct business advantages over alternate online distribution technologies.""). Compare Decl. of Brewster Kahle ¶ 20, id., at 142 (""Those who download the Prelinger films . . . are entitled to redistribute those files, and the Archive welcomes their redistribution by the Morpheus-Grokster-KaZaa community of users.""), with Deposition of Brewster Kahle (Sept. 18, 947*947 2002), id., at 396-403 (testifying that he has no knowledge of any person downloading a Prelinger film using Morpheus, Grokster, or KaZaA). Compare also Decl. of Richard Prelinger ¶ 17, id., at 147 (""e welcome further redistribution of the Prelinger films . . . by individuals using peer-to-peer software products like Morpheus, KaZaA and Grokster.""), with Deposition of Richard Prelinger (Oct. 1, 2002), id., at 410-411 (""Q. What is your understanding of Grokster? A. I have no understanding of Grokster. . . . Q. Do you know whether any user of the Grokster software has made available to share any Prelinger film? A. No.""). See also Deposition of Aram Sinnreich (Sept. 25, 2002), id., at 390 (testimony about the band Wilco based on ""he press and industry news groups and scuttlebutt.""). These declarations do not support summary judgment in the face of evidence, proffered by MGM, of overwhelming use of Grokster's and StreamCast's software for infringement.
Even if the absolute number of noninfringing files copied using the Grokster and StreamCast software is large, it does not follow that the products are therefore put to substantial noninfringing uses and are thus immune from liability. The number of noninfringing copies may be reflective of, and dwarfed by, the huge total volume of files shared. Further, the District Court and the Court of Appeals did not sharply distinguish between uses of Grokster's and StreamCast's software products (which this case is about) and uses of peer-to-peer technology generally (which this case is not about).
In sum, when the record in this case was developed, there was evidence that Grokster's and StreamCast's products were, and had been for some time, overwhelmingly used to infringe, ante, at; App. 434-439, 476-481, and that this infringement was the overwhelming source of revenue from the products, ante, at 925-926; 259 F. Supp. 2d, at 1043-1044. Fairly appraised, the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate, beyond genuine debate, a reasonable prospect that substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses were likely to develop over time. On this record, the District Court should not have ruled dispositively on the contributory infringement charge by granting summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast.
If, on remand, the case is not resolved on summary judgment in favor of MGM based on Grokster and StreamCast actively inducing infringement, the Court of Appeals, I would emphasize, should reconsider, on a fuller record, its interpretation of Sony's product distribution holding.
JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS and JUSTICE O'CONNOR join, concurring.
I agree with the Court that the distributor of a dual-use technology may be liable for the infringing activities of third parties where he or she actively seeks to advance the infringement. Ante, at 919. I further agree that, in light of our holding today, we need not now ""revisit"" Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417 (1984). Ante, at 934. Other Members of the Court, however, take up the Sony question: whether Grokster's product is ""capable of `substantial' or `commercially significant' noninfringing uses."" Ante, at 942 (GINSBURG, J., concurring) (quoting Sony, supra, at 442). And they answer that question by stating that the Court of Appeals was wrong when it granted summary judgment on the issue in Grokster's favor. Ante, at 944. I write to explain why I disagree with them on this matter.
I.  The Court's opinion in Sony and the record evidence (as described and analyzed in the many briefs before us) together convince me that the Court of Appeals' conclusion has adequate legal support.
A.  I begin with Sony's standard. In Sony, the Court considered the potential copyright liability of a company that did not itself illegally copy protected material, but rather sold a machine—a videocassette recorder (VCR)—that could be used to do so. A buyer could use that machine for non-infringing purposes, such as recording for later viewing (sometimes called ""`time-shifting,'"" Sony, 464 U. S., at 421) uncopyrighted television programs or copyrighted programs with a copyright holder's permission. The buyer could use the machine for infringing purposes as well, such as building libraries of taped copyrighted programs. Or, the buyer might use the machine to record copyrighted programs under circumstances in which the legal status of the act of recording was uncertain (i. e., where the copying may, or may not, have constituted a ""fair use,"" id., at 425-426). Sony knew many customers would use its VCRs to engage in unauthorized copying and ""`library-building.'"" Id., at 458-459 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). But that fact, said the Court, was insufficient to make Sony itself an infringer. And the Court ultimately held that Sony was not liable for its customers' acts of infringement.
In reaching this conclusion, the Court recognized the need for the law, in fixing secondary copyright liability, to ""strike a balance between a copyright holder's legitimate demand for effective—not merely symbolic—protection of the statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce."" Id., at 442. It pointed to patent law's ""staple article of commerce"" doctrine, ibid., under which a distributor of a product is not liable for patent infringement by its customers unless that product is ""unsuited for any commercial noninfringing use."" Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co., 448 U. S. 176, 198 (1980). The Court wrote that the sale of copying equipment, ""like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses."" Sony, 464 U. S., at 442 (emphasis added). The Court ultimately characterized the legal ""question"" in the particular case as ""whether  is capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses"" (while declining to give ""precise content"" to these terms). Ibid. (emphasis added).
It then applied this standard. The Court had before it a survey (commissioned by the District Court and then prepared by the respondents) showing that roughly 9% of all VCR recordings were of the type—namely, religious, educational, and sports programming—owned by producers and distributors testifying on Sony's behalf who did not object to time-shifting. See Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1983, No. 81-1687, pp. 52-53; see also Sony, supra, at 424 (7.3% of all Sony VCR use is to record sports programs; representatives of the sports leagues do not object). A much higher percentage of VCR users had at one point taped an authorized program, in addition to taping unauthorized programs. And the plaintiffs—not a large class of content providers as in this case—owned only a small percentage of the total available unauthorized programming. See ante, at 947, n. 3 (GINSBURG, J., concurring). But of all the taping actually done by Sony's customers, only around 9% was of the sort the Court referred to as authorized.
The Court found that the magnitude of authorized programming was ""significant,"" and it also noted the ""significant potential for future authorized copying."" 464 U. S., at 444. The Court supported this conclusion by referencing the trial testimony of professional sports league officials and a religious broadcasting representative. Id., at 444, and n. 24. It also discussed (1) a Los Angeles educational station affiliated with the Public Broadcasting Service that made many of its programs available for home taping, and (2) Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, a widely watched children's program. Id., at 445. On the basis of this testimony and other similar evidence, the Court determined that producers of this kind had authorized duplication of their copyrighted programs ""in significant enough numbers to create a substantial market for a noninfringing use of the"" VCR. Id., at 447, n. 28 (emphasis added).
The Court, in using the key word ""substantial,"" indicated that these circumstances alone constituted a sufficient basis for rejecting the imposition of secondary liability. See id., at 456 (""Sony demonstrated a significant likelihood that substantial numbers of copyright holders"" would not object to time-shifting (emphasis added)). Nonetheless, the Court buttressed its conclusion by finding separately that, in any event, un-authorized time-shifting often constituted not infringement, but ""fair use."" Id., at 447-456.
B.  When measured against Sony's underlying evidence and analysis, the evidence now before us shows that Grokster passes Sony's test—that is, whether the company's product is capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses. Id., at 442. For one thing, petitioners' (hereinafter MGM) own expert declared that 75% of current files available on Grokster are infringing and 15% are ""likely infringing."" See App. 436-439, ¶¶ 6-17 (Decl. of Dr. Ingram Olkin); cf. ante, at 922 (opinion of the Court). That leaves some number of files near 10% that apparently are noninfringing, a figure very similar to the 9% or so of authorized time-shifting uses of the VCR that the Court faced in Sony.
As in Sony, witnesses here explained the nature of the noninfringing files on Grokster's network without detailed quantification. Those files include:
—Authorized copies of music by artists such as Wilco, Janis Ian, Pearl Jam, Dave Matthews, John Mayer, and others. See App. 152-153, ¶¶ 9-13 (Decl. of Aram Sinnreich) (Wilco's ""lesson has already been adopted by artists still signed to their major labels""); id., at 170, ¶¶ 5-7 (Decl. of Patricia D. Hoekman) (locating ""numerous audio recordings"" that were authorized for swapping); id., at 74, ¶ 10 (Decl. of Daniel B. Rung) (describing Grokster's partnership with a company that hosts music from thousands of independent artists)
—Free electronic books and other works from various online publishers, including Project Gutenberg. See id., at 136, ¶ 12 (Decl. of Gregory Newby) (""Numerous authorized and public domain Project Gutenberg eBooks are made available"" on Grokster. Project Gutenberg ""welcomes this widespread 953*953 sharing . . . using these software products since they assist us in meeting our objectives""); id., at 159-160, ¶ 32 (Decl. of Sinnreich)
—Public domain and authorized software, such as WinZip 8.1. Id., at 170, ¶ 8 (Decl. of Hoekman); id., at 165, ¶¶ 4-7 (Decl. of John Busher)
—Licensed music videos and television and movie segments distributed via digital video packaging with the permission of the copyright holder. Id., at 70, ¶ 24 (Decl. of Sean L. Mayers).
The nature of these and other lawfully swapped files is such that it is reasonable to infer quantities of current lawful use roughly approximate to those at issue in Sony. At least, MGM has offered no evidence sufficient to survive summary judgment that could plausibly demonstrate a significant quantitative difference. See ante, at 922 (opinion of the Court); see also Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners i (referring to ""at least 90% of the total use of the services""); but see ante, at 947, n. 3 (GINSBURG, J., concurring). To be sure, in quantitative terms these uses account for only a small percentage of the total number of uses of Grokster's product. But the same was true in Sony, which characterized the relatively limited authorized copying market as ""substantial."" (The Court made clear as well in Sony that the amount of material then presently available for lawful copying—if not actually copied— was significant, see 464 U. S., at 444, and the same is certainly true in this case.)
Importantly, Sony also used the word ""capable,"" asking whether the product is ""capable of"" substantial noninfringing uses. Its language and analysis suggest that a figure like 10%, if fixed for all time, might well prove insufficient, but that such a figure serves as an adequate foundation where there is a reasonable prospect of expanded legitimate uses over time. See ibid. (noting a ""significant potential for future authorized copying""). And its language also indicates 954*954 the appropriateness of looking to potential future uses of the product to determine its ""capability.""
Here the record reveals a significant future market for noninfringing uses of Grokster-type peer-to-peer software. Such software permits the exchange of any sort of digital file—whether that file does, or does not, contain copyrighted material. As more and more uncopyrighted information is stored in swappable form, it seems a likely inference that lawful peer-to-peer sharing will become increasingly prevalent. See, e. g., App. 142, ¶ 20 (Decl. of Brewster Kahle) (""he  welcomes  redistribution  by the Morpheus-Grokster-KaZaa community of users""); id., at 166, ¶ 8 (Decl. of Busher) (sales figures of $1,000 to $10,000 per month through peer-to-peer networks ""will increase in the future as Acoustica's trialware is more widely distributed through these networks""); id., at 156-163, ¶¶ 21-40 (Decl. of Sinnreich).
And that is just what is happening. Such legitimate noninfringing uses are coming to include the swapping of: research information (the initial purpose of many peer-to-peer networks); public domain films (e. g., those owned by the Prelinger Archive); historical recordings and digital educational materials (e. g., those stored on the Internet Archive); digital photos (OurPictures, for example, is starting a P2P photo-swapping service); ""shareware"" and ""freeware"" (e. g., Linux and certain Windows software); secure licensed music and movie files (Intent MediaWorks, for example, protects licensed content sent across P2P networks); news broadcasts past and present (the BBC Creative Archive lets users ""rip, mix and share the BBC""); user-created audio and video files (including ""podcasts"" that may be distributed through P2P software); and all manner of free ""open content"" works collected by Creative Commons (one can search for Creative Commons material on StreamCast). See Brief for Distributed Computing Industry Association as Amicus Curiae 15-26; Merges, A New Dynamism in the Public Domain, 71 955*955 U. Chi. L. Rev. 183 (2004). I can find nothing in the record that suggests that this course of events will not continue to flow naturally as a consequence of the character of the software taken together with the foreseeable development of the Internet and of information technology. Cf. ante, at 920 (opinion of the Court) (discussing the significant benefits of peer-to-peer technology).
There may be other now-unforeseen noninfringing uses that develop for peer-to-peer software, just as the homevideo rental industry (unmentioned in Sony) developed for the VCR. But the foreseeable development of such uses, when taken together with an estimated 10% noninfringing material, is sufficient to meet Sony's standard. And while Sony considered the record following a trial, there are no facts asserted by MGM in its summary judgment filings that lead me to believe the outcome after a trial here could be any different. The lower courts reached the same conclusion.
Of course, Grokster itself may not want to develop these other noninfringing uses. But Sony's standard seeks to protect not the Groksters of this world (which in any event may well be liable under today's holding), but the development of technology more generally. And Grokster's desires in this respect are beside the point.
II.  The real question here, I believe, is not whether the record evidence satisfies Sony. As I have interpreted the standard set forth in that case, it does. And of the Courts of Appeals that have considered the matter, only one has proposed interpreting Sony more strictly than I would do—in a case where the product might have failed under any standard. In re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334 F. 3d 643, 653 (CA7 2003) (defendant ""failed to show that its service is ever used for any purpose other than to infringe"" copyrights (emphasis added)); see Matthew Bender & Co. v. West Pub. Co., 158 956*956 F. 3d 693, 706-707 (CA2 1998) (court did not require that noninfringing uses be ""predominant,"" it merely found that they were predominant, and therefore provided no analysis of Sony's boundaries); but see ante, at 944, n. 1 (GINSBURG, J., concurring); see also A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F. 3d 1004, 1020 (CA9 2001) (discussing Sony); Cable/Home Communication Corp. v. Network Productions, Inc., 902 F. 2d 829, 842-847 (CA11 1990) (same); Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software, Ltd., 847 F. 2d 255, 262 (CA5 1988) (same); cf. Dynacore Holdings Corp. v. U. S. Philips Corp., 363 F. 3d 1263, 1275 (CA Fed. 2004) (same); see also Doe v. GTE Corp., 347 F. 3d 655, 661 (CA7 2003) (""A person may be liable as a contributory infringer if the product or service it sells has no (or only slight) legal use"").
Instead, the real question is whether we should modify the Sony standard, as MGM requests, or interpret Sony more strictly, as I believe JUSTICE GINSBURG'S approach would do in practice. Compare ante, at 944-948 (concurring opinion) (insufficient evidence in this case of both present lawful uses and of a reasonable prospect that substantial noninfringing uses would develop over time), with Sony, 464 U. S., at 442-447 (basing conclusion as to the likely existence of a substantial market for authorized copying upon general declarations, some survey data, and common sense).
As I have said, Sony itself sought to ""strike a balance between a copyright holder's legitimate demand for effective— not merely symbolic—protection of the statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce."" Id., at 442. Thus, to determine whether modification, or a strict interpretation, of Sony is needed, I would ask whether MGM has shown that Sony incorrectly balanced copyright and new-technology interests. In particular: (1) Has Sony (as I interpret it) worked to protect new technology? (2) If so, would modification or strict interpretation significantly weaken that protection? (3) If so, would new or necessary copyright-related benefits outweigh any such weakening?
A.  The first question is the easiest to answer. Sony's rule, as I interpret it, has provided entrepreneurs with needed assurance that they will be shielded from copyright liability as they bring valuable new technologies to market.
Sony's rule is clear. That clarity allows those who develop new products that are capable of substantial noninfringing uses to know, ex ante, that distribution of their product will not yield massive monetary liability. At the same time, it helps deter them from distributing products that have no other real function than—or that are specifically intended for—copyright infringement, deterrence that the Court's holding today reinforces (by adding a weapon to the copyright holder's legal arsenal).
Sony's rule is strongly technology protecting. The rule deliberately makes it difficult for courts to find secondary liability where new technology is at issue. It establishes that the law will not impose copyright liability upon the distributors of dual-use technologies (who do not themselves engage in unauthorized copying) unless the product in question will be used almost exclusively to infringe copyrights (or unless they actively induce infringements as we today describe). Sony thereby recognizes that the copyright laws are not intended to discourage or to control the emergence of new technologies, including (perhaps especially) those that help disseminate information and ideas more broadly or more efficiently. Thus Sony's rule shelters VCRs, typewriters, tape recorders, photocopiers, computers, cassette players, compact disc burners, digital video recorders, MP3 players, Internet search engines, and peer-to-peer software. But Sony's rule does not shelter descramblers, even if one could theoretically use a descrambler in a noninfringing way. 464 U. S., at 441-442. Compare Cable/Home Communication Corp., supra, at 837-850 (developer liable for advertising television signal descrambler), with Vault Corp., supra, at 262 (primary use infringing but a substantial noninfringing use).
Sony's rule is forward looking. It does not confine its scope to a static snapshot of a product's current uses (thereby threatening technologies that have undeveloped future markets). Rather, as the VCR example makes clear, a product's market can evolve dramatically over time. And Sony—by referring to a capacity for substantial noninfringing uses—recognizes that fact. Sony's word ""capable"" refers to a plausible, not simply a theoretical, likelihood that such uses will come to pass, and that fact anchors Sony in practical reality. Cf. Aimster, 334 F. 3d, at 651.
Sony's rule is mindful of the limitations facing judges where matters of technology are concerned. Judges have no specialized technical ability to answer questions about present or future technological feasibilility or commercial viability where technology professionals, engineers, and venture capitalists themselves may radically disagree and where answers may differ depending upon whether one focuses upon the time of product development or the time of distribution. Consider, for example, the question whether devices can be added to Grokster's software that will filter out infringing files. MGM tells us this is easy enough to do, as do several amici that produce and sell the filtering technology. See, e. g., Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 11; Brief for Audible Magic Corp. et al. as Amici Curiae 3-10. Grokster says it is not at all easy to do, and not an efficient solution in any event, and several apparently disinterested computer science professors agree. See Brief for Respondents 31; Brief for Computer Science Professor Harold Abelson et al. as Amici Curiae 6-10, 14-18. Which account should a judge credit? Sony says that the judge will not necessarily have to decide.
Given the nature of the Sony rule, it is not surprising that in the last 20 years, there have been relatively few contributory infringement suits—based on a product distribution theory—brought against technology providers (a small handful of federal appellate court cases and perhaps fewer than two dozen District Court cases in the last 20 years). I have found nothing in the briefs or the record that shows that Sony has failed to achieve its innovation-protecting objective.
B.  The second, more difficult, question is whether a modified Sony rule (or a strict interpretation) would significantly weaken the law's ability to protect new technology. JUSTICE GINSBURG'S approach would require defendants to produce considerably more concrete evidence—more than was presented here—to earn Sony's shelter. That heavier evidentiary demand, and especially the more dramatic (case-by-case balancing) modifications that MGM and the Government seek, would, I believe, undercut the protection that Sony now offers.
To require defendants to provide, for example, detailed evidence—say, business plans, profitability estimates, projected technological modifications, and so forth—would doubtless make life easier for copyright holder plaintiffs. But it would simultaneously increase the legal uncertainty that surrounds the creation or development of a new technology capable of being put to infringing uses. Inventors and entrepreneurs (in the garage, the dorm room, the corporate lab, or the boardroom) would have to fear (and in many cases endure) costly and extensive trials when they create, produce, or distribute the sort of information technology that can be used for copyright infringement. They would often be left guessing as to how a court, upon later review of the product and its uses, would decide when necessarily rough estimates amounted to sufficient evidence. They would have no way to predict how courts would weigh the respective 960*960 values of infringing and noninfringing uses; determine the efficiency and advisability of technological changes; or assess a product's potential future markets. The price of a wrong guess—even if it involves a good-faith effort to assess technical and commercial viability—could be large statutory damages (not less than $750 and up to $30,000 per infringed work). 17 U. S. C. § 504(c)(1). The additional risk and uncertainty would mean a consequent additional chill of technological development.
C.  The third question—whether a positive copyright impact would outweigh any technology-related loss—I find the most difficult of the three. I do not doubt that a more intrusive Sony test would generally provide greater revenue security for copyright holders. But it is harder to conclude that the gains on the copyright swings would exceed the losses on the technology roundabouts.
For one thing, the law disfavors equating the two different kinds of gain and loss; rather, it leans in favor of protecting technology. As Sony itself makes clear, the producer of a technology which permits unlawful copying does not himself engage in unlawful copying—a fact that makes the attachment of copyright liability to the creation, production, or distribution of the technology an exceptional thing. See 464 U. S., at 431 (courts ""must be circumspect"" in construing the copyright laws to preclude distribution of new technologies). Moreover, Sony has been the law for some time. And that fact imposes a serious burden upon copyright holders like MGM to show a need for change in the current rules of the game, including a more strict interpretation of the test. See, e. g., Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 31 (Sony should not protect products when the ""primary or principal"" use is infringing).
In any event, the evidence now available does not, in my view, make out a sufficiently strong case for change. To say 961*961 this is not to doubt the basic need to protect copyrighted material from infringement. The Constitution itself stresses the vital role that copyright plays in advancing the ""useful Arts."" Art. I, § 8, cl. 8. No one disputes that ""reward to the author or artist serves to induce release to the public of the products of his creative genius."" United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U. S. 131, 158 (1948). And deliberate unlawful copying is no less an unlawful taking of property than garden-variety theft. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. § 2319 (2000 ed. and Supp. II) (criminal copyright infringement); § 1961(1)(B) (2000 ed., Supp. II) (copyright infringement can be a predicate act under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act); § 1956(c)(7)(D) (2000 ed., Supp. II) (money laundering includes the receipt of proceeds from copyright infringement). But these highly general principles cannot by themselves tell us how to balance the interests at issue in Sony or whether Sony's standard needs modification. And at certain key points, information is lacking.
Will an unmodified Sony lead to a significant diminution in the amount or quality of creative work produced? Since copyright's basic objective is creation and its revenue objectives but a means to that end, this is the underlying copyright question. See Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U. S. 151, 156 (1975) (""Creative work is to be encouraged and rewarded, but private motivation must ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature, music, and the other arts""). And its answer is far from clear.
Unauthorized copying likely diminishes industry revenue, though it is not clear by how much. Compare S. Liebowitz, Will MP3 Downloads Annihilate the Record Industry? The Evidence So Far 2 (June 2003), http://www.utdallas.edu/ ~liebowit/intprop/records.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 24, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) 962*962 (file sharing has caused a decline in music sales), and Press Release, Informa Telecoms & Media, Steady Download Growth Defies P2P (Dec. 6, 2004), http://www.informatm.com (citing Informa Media Group Report, Music on the Internet (5th ed. 2004)) (estimating total lost sales to the music industry in the range of $2 billion annually), with F. Oberholzer & K. Strumpf, The Effect of File Sharing on Record Sales: An Empirical Analysis 24 (Mar. 2004), www.unc.edu/ñcigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf (academic study concluding that ""file sharing has no statistically significant effect on purchases of the average album""), and D. McGuire, Study: File-Sharing No Threat to Music Sales (Mar. 29, 2004), http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A34300-2004Mar29?language=printer (discussing mixed evidence).
The extent to which related production has actually and resultingly declined remains uncertain, though there is good reason to believe that the decline, if any, is not substantial. See, e. g., M. Madden, Pew Internet & American Life Project, Artists, Musicians, and the Internet 21 (Dec. 5, 2004), http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Artists. Musicians_Report.pdf (nearly 70% of musicians believe that file sharing is a minor threat or no threat at all to creative industries); Benkler, Sharing Nicely: On Shareable Goods and the Emergence of Sharing as a Modality of Economic Production, 114 Yale L. J. 273, 351-352 (2004) (""Much of the actual flow of revenue to artists—from performances and other sources—is stable even assuming a complete displacement of the CD market by peer-to-peer distribution . . . . t would be silly to think that music, a cultural form without which no human society has existed, will cease to be in our world "").
More importantly, copyright holders at least potentially have other tools available to reduce piracy and to abate whatever threat it poses to creative production. As today's opinion makes clear, a copyright holder may proceed against a technology provider where a provable specific intent to infringe (of the kind the Court describes) is present. Ante, at 941. Services like Grokster may well be liable under an inducement theory.
In addition, a copyright holder has always had the legal authority to bring a traditional infringement suit against one who wrongfully copies. Indeed, since September 2003, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has filed ""thousands of suits against people for sharing copyrighted material."" Walker, New Movement Hits Universities: Get Legal Music, Washington Post, Mar. 17, 2005, p. E1. These suits have provided copyright holders with damages; have served as a teaching tool, making clear that much file sharing, if done without permission, is unlawful; and apparently have had a real and significant deterrent effect. See, e. g., L. Rainie, M. Madden, D. Hess, & G. Mudd, Pew Internet Project and comScore Media Metrix Data Memo: The state of music downloading and file-sharing online 2, 4, 6, 10 (Apr. 2004), http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Filesharing_April_04.pdf (number of people downloading files fell from a peak of roughly 35 million to roughly 23 million in the year following the first suits; 38% of current downloaders report downloading fewer files because of the suits); M. Madden & L. Rainie, Pew Internet Project Data Memo: Music and video downloading moves beyond P2P, p. 7 (Mar. 2005), http://www. pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Filesharing_March05.pdf (number of downloaders has ""inched up"" but ""continues to rest well below the peak level""); Note, Costs and Benefits of the Recording Industry's Litigation Against Individuals, 20 Berkeley Tech. L. J. 571 (2005); but see Evangelista, File Sharing; Downloading Music and Movie Files is as Popular as Ever, San Francisco Chronicle, Mar. 28, 2005, p. E1 (referring to the continuing ""tide of rampant copyright infringement,"" while noting that the RIAA says it believes the ""campaign of lawsuits and public education has at least contained the problem"").
Further, copyright holders may develop new technological devices that will help curb unlawful infringement. Some new technology, called ""digital `watermarking'"" and ""digital fingerprint,"" can encode within the file information about the author and the copyright scope and date, which ""fingerprints"" can help to expose infringers. RIAA Reveals Method to Madness, Wired News (Aug. 28, 2003), http:// www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,60222,00.html; Besek, Anti-Circumvention Laws and Copyright: A Report from the Kernochan Center for Law, Media and the Arts, 27 Colum. J. L. & Arts 385, 391, 451 (2004). Other technology can, through encryption, potentially restrict users' ability to make a digital copy. See J. Borland, Tripping the Rippers, C/net News.com (Sept. 28, 2001), http://news.com.com/ Tripping+the+rippers/XXXX-XXXX_X-XXXXXX.html; but see Brief for Bridgemar Services, Ltd. d/b/a iMesh.com as Amicus Curiae 5-8 (arguing that peer-to-peer service providers can more easily block unlawful swapping).
At the same time, advances in technology have discouraged unlawful copying by making lawful copying (e. g., downloading music with the copyright holder's permission) cheaper and easier to achieve. Several services now sell music for less than $1 per song. (Walmart.com, for example, charges $0.88 each.) Consequently, many consumers initially attracted to the convenience and flexibility of services like Grokster are now migrating to lawful paid services (services with copying permission) where they can enjoy at little cost even greater convenience and flexibility without engaging in unlawful swapping. See Wu, When Code Isn't Law, 89 Va. L. Rev. 679, 731-735 (2003) (noting the prevalence of technological problems on unpaid swapping sites); K. Dean, P2P Tilts Toward Legitimacy, Wired News (Nov. 24, 2004), http://www.wired.com/news/ digiwood/0,1412,65836,00.html; Madden & Rainie, March 2005 Data Memo, supra, at 6-8 (percentage of current downloaders who have used paid services rose from 24% to 43% in a year; number using free services fell from 58% to 41%).
Thus, lawful music downloading services—those that charge the customer for downloading music and pay royalties to the copyright holder—have continued to grow and to produce substantial revenue. See Brief for Internet Law Faculty as Amicus Curiae 5-20; Bruno, Digital Entertainment: Piracy Fight Shows Encouraging Signs (Mar. 5, 2005), available at LEXIS, News Library, Billboard File (in 2004, consumers worldwide purchased more than 10 times the number of digital tracks purchased in 2003; global digital music market of $330 million in 2004 expected to double in 2005); Press Release, Informa Telecoms & Media, Steady Download Growth Defies P2P (global digital revenues will likely exceed $3 billion in 2010); Ashton,  Predicts Downloads Will Hit the Mainstream, Music Week, Jan. 29, 2005, p. 6 (legal music sites and portable MP3 players ""are helping to transform the digital music market"" into ""an everyday consumer experience""). And more advanced types of non-music-oriented peer-to-peer networks have also started to develop, drawing in part on the lessons of Grokster.
Finally, as Sony recognized, the legislative option remains available. Courts are less well suited than Congress to the task of ""accommodat fully the varied permutations of competing interests that are inevitably implicated by such new technology."" Sony, 464 U. S., at 431; see, e. g., Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, 106 Stat. 4237 (adding 17 U. S. C., ch. 10); Protecting Innovation and Art While Preventing Piracy: Hearing before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 108th Cong., 2d Sess. (2004).
I do not know whether these developments and similar alternatives will prove sufficient, but I am reasonably certain that, given their existence, a strong demonstrated need for modifying Sony (or for interpreting Sony's standard more strictly) has not yet been shown. That fact, along with the added risks that modification (or strict interpretation) would impose upon technological innovation, leads me to the conclusion that we should maintain Sony, reading its standard as I have read it. As so read, it requires affirmance of the Ninth Circuit's determination of the relevant aspects of the Sony question.

Wait for now

And I will wait, I will wait for you

So break my step
And relent
Well you forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen

Now in some way
Shake the excess

As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind, freed from the lies

But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground

Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back
She hid around corners, and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses, and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done

Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers

Quelques partenaires, quelques amis bâtards
La beuh est bien verte, couleur alligator
Têtu mais j’avoue quand j’ai tort
J’vais baiser l’rap français quand j’ai l’temps

Laisse-les parler
J’ai perdu l’amour, j'l’ai laissé partir parce que y’en a d’autres

It pales in comparison to mix with the fuckin' beat
Like Wookies and Harrison did it, rookie be handlin' his business
Rottin' your fuckin' brain like the box that you're starin' in
The unescapable, unexplainable, band-unbreakable, unmistakable
Scent of hatred stuffed up in my nasal
Breathe it in and leave it in, let it soak in these heathens
And these demons could really use a good ass reamin'
So I give it to 'em, spit it to 'em
Apocalyptic visions of cities in ruin
I'm doing whatever it takes for the sake of argument
Show you that the target's us
While you lay on your back begging to fuck

And since birth I been cursed to disperse the substance
And accusations, relations and it cause hesitations
My blood pressure rise like the state of inflation
I'm pacin' two steps, turn around fast
But I'm one step to late, sand in the hour glass
I'm standin' here like an asshole and wastin' my chance
While I live here in this black hole, see it at a glance
You'll miss it, guaranteed, you'll never get it
Let it eat away at your skin, ooh God bless it
My vision stays hidden like telephone women
I give it everything I got and I'm so tired of living
Get 'em wild and I feel it's my duty to tell the truth
And I'm sorry that all I got is warnings and no proof
And I know that none of you believe my conspiracy theories

It's like the Brains in DC, man of police
Somebody stuck HR, now the man is crazy
Maybe it just helps to have an explanation for myself
I shake in public on me the eyes I felt 'em
On my back like Eastpaks, watchin' over my actions
I can live with that
But the inside of my brain, fuck I can't have that
They couldn't possibly understand the thoughts of a simple man
Who's a simpleton, got a simple plan from a simple fam
Well damn, this is higher-ups
That touch what doesn't belong to 'em, I'm on to 'em
Paranoid? Yes
Anxious, always
The moment is upon us cause they slippin' in they old age

1. EXT. NEW YORK - LIBERTY ISLAND - DAY
The STATUE OF LIBERTY stands watch at the mouth of the Hudson.  Over
scene, we SUPER TITLE:
NEW YORK CITY - JULY 1976
2. JERSEY CITY PIER - DAY
A live news update.  Network correspondent CINDY CHAN stands at the
edge of the  dock, the statue plainly visible in the distance behind
her.
CINDY
-- insist that the situation is under control.  Authorities have just
agreed to the release of nine Radical Front prisoners in hopes of
freeing the hostages.
(adjusting her hair)
We repeat: terrorists have taken Liberty Island, and are holding some
forty hostages -- including tourists and maintenance workers --
captive in the Statue of Liberty itself.
3. FERRYBOAT - DAY
The ferry -- one of six anchored a half-mile off Liberty Island --
has been commandeered by a fully-armed SWAT TEAM.  The SWAT CAPTAIN,
who's in charge of negotiations, speaks to the terrorists via
walkie-talkie.
SWAT CAPTAIN
Your demands have been met.  The prisoners and the money are on their
way.  If you tune your TV to Channel 4 you'll see the copters
preparing for takeoff.
4. INT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT
The screen of a portable TV shows THREE HELICOPTERS lifting off from
Laguardia.  We're in the OBSERVATION ROOM inside the statue's head.
A TERRORIST holds a crowd of SQUEALING TOURISTS -- men, women,
schoolchildren -- at bay with an automatic rifle.  Two others stand
by the windows, scanning the harbor for signs of a double-cross; and
a fourth, the RINGLEADER, speaks into a walkie-talkie.
RINGLEADER
Good.  We got forty innocent people here.  One false move . . . and
we blow her brains out.
SWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)
(filter; from walkie-talkie)
Blow whose brains out?
5. EXT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT
TIGHT on the ring of OBSERVATION WINDOWS situated just below the
jutting spikes of the CROWN.  CAMERA PULLS BACK rapidly to take in
the whole of the statue's head.
RINGLEADER (O.S.)
(a nasty laugh)
Lady Liberty, my friend.  Lady Liberty's brains!
6. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT - DAY
MOUNTING TENSION among the SWAT TEAM on deck.
SWAT COP
Sons of bitches.
SWAT CAPTAIN
Relax.  We'll nail 'em on the transfer.  Let's get those hostages out
first.
SWAT COP II
Captain . . . what the hell is that?
All eyes turn upward.  In the distance, a TINY SPECK descends from
the clouds and drops, in a perfectly vertical line, toward the head
of the statue.  The SWAT CAPTAIN hoists a pair of binoculars:
SWAT CAPTAIN
Shit.  Shit fire!!
SWAT COP
Sir!  What is it?
7. POV SHOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS
A magnified view of the SPECK, which turns out to be a futuristic,
blimplike HOVERCRAFT -- the OWLSHIP.
SWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)
Christ almighty, it's the goddamned Watchmen!
8. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
In the cabin we find THREE COSTUMED SUPERHEROES: the red-and-gold
suited CAPTAIN METROPOLIS; RORSCHACH, whose face is a shifting
inkblot mask; and NIGHT OWL, who's manning the instrument panel.
NIGHT OWL
Okay, Adrian, we're in position.  What now?
He looks up at a monitor mounted over the controls.  ADRIAN VEIDT,
blond scientific wizard, answers pensively from Watchmen HQ:
VEIDT
(on monitor)
Let's take out their communications.  Drop the scrambler.
9. EXT. HEAD OF STATUE - DAY
A line drops from the OWLSHIP, and an ELECTRONIC DEVICE lands with a
thud on the dome of Lady Liberty's crown.
10. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
TERRORISTS staring at the portable TV screen; suddenly, it shows
nothing but snow.  The RINGLEADER, suspicious, lifts his
walkie-talkie:
RINGLEADER
Hey.  We got a problem here --
He releases the button.  No reply -- only loud, hissing STATIC.
RINGLEADER
Come in.  Do you read me?  Don't play around with us,
Goddammit !
11. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT
The SWAT CAPTAIN curses at his useless walkie-talkie.  Teeth bared,
he glowers up at the OWLSHIP and paces the deck in a psychotic
frenzy.
SWAT COP
Ignorant bastards!  They've jammed us!
SWAT COP II
What do we do now?
SWAT CAPTAIN
We sit here with our thumbs up our butts.  As usual.
12. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY
A HULKING FIGURE, outfitted in SCUBA GEAR, emerges from the water.
There's an evil-looking RIFLE slung over his shoulder.  As he
swaggers toward the base of the statue, he peels off his wetsuit to
reveal yet another gaudy COSTUME underneath.
Superhero #4: THE COMEDIAN.  He pins a BADGE to his leather
breastplate; incongruously, it's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON -- and it
matches his own nasty SMILE as he marches forward into battle.
13. INT. BASE OF STATUE - THAT MOMENT - DAY
A TRIO OF TERRORISTS standing guard near the entrance in the base of
the statue.  They're holding a JANITOR at gunpoint.  One of them is
fumbling with his walkie-talkie, which has inexplicably gone
haywire.
TERRORIST I
Base to head.  Base to head.  Come in!
(flustered)
I can't get shit!
TERRORIST II
What the hell is going on??
There's a sudden metallic CLANG behind them.  They turn in unison --
just as the COMEDIAN struts into frame, assault rifle in hand.
Panic.  The three TERRORISTS fall into a tight cluster at the base of
a long metal stairway.  One of them grabs the JANITOR, holds a gun to
his head.
TERRORIST I
I'M NOT JOKING!!
The COMEDIAN shrugs: okay.  He lifts his rifle and fires TWO SILENCED
SHOTS directly into the JANITOR's gut.  The old man's body jerks twice
and he slumps to the floor, stone dead.
The TERRORISTS stand there aghast.  For an instant they're too
stunned to shoot.  The COMEDIAN breaks into a dopey grin --
COMEDIAN
The joke's on you.
-- and opens fire with a look of VICIOUS PLEASURE on his face.  As
the saying goes . . . it's nice to see a man who enjoys his work.
14. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS stand over an open hatch in the floor
of the cabin.  At the console, NIGHT OWL hits a button.  Then --
15. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
A sudden BOOM.  A FLASH OF COLOR.  The startled TERRORISTS turn to
the nearest window, and see a spectacular display of BICENTENNIAL
FIREWORKS bursting above the harbor a short distance away.
While the TERRORISTS are distracted, our attention shifts to a point
behind them.  Through an OBSERVATION WINDOW we see CAPT. METROPOLIS
and RORSCHACH sliding down a thin metal cable and LANDING on the
statue's upraised TORCH.
The TERRORISTS turn back just as the superheroes disappear around the
far side of the torch.
RINGLEADER
I don't like this.  Go downstairs and see what's up.
16. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - THAT MOMENT - DAY
RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS pry open a metal door on the torch.
RORSCHACH
Got your flashgun?
CAPT. METROPOLIS nods.  He puts on a pair of IONIZED SUNGLASSES and
goes through the door, into the torch.  RORSCHACH waits
behind.
17. INT. BASE OF STATUE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
The COMEDIAN is wandering around with a MAP of the statue's layout.
He spots what looks like a MANHOLE COVER set in the concrete floor,
then strolls over and jimmies it open.
ANOTHER FIGURE in scuba gear climbs out.  But this one's different.
This one's a WOMAN.
SILK SPECTRE
About time.  It stinks down there.
COMEDIAN
B-team's upstairs.  We gotta find that bomb.
As the COMEDIAN saunters off, she strips out of her slime-drenched
wetsuit.  You guessed it -- a garish (and kinda skimpy) COSTUME
underneath.
SILK SPECTRE
Why do I get all the glamour jobs?
COMEDIAN
A woman's work is never done.
18. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT - DAY
The TERRORISTS tense up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS.  A moment later,
CAPT. METROPOLIS appears on the stairs.  The TERRORISTS train their
guns on him -- all but the RINGLEADER, who grabs a
TEN-YEAR-OLD-GIRL.
RINGLEADER
I don't know who you are pal, but you just killed a little girl.
CAPT. METROPOLIS
Please.  There's something I'd like you to see first.
He holds up what looks like an old-fashioned photographer's flash.
All at once, the ROOM GOES WHITE -- and by the time the blinding
light has dimmed, TERRORISTS and HOSTAGES alike are toppling to the
floor, their nervous systems temporarily FRIED.
All except CAPT. METROPOLIS, who's wearing his special sunglasses.
He pockets the shades and swiftly goes to work.
19. INT. STATUE - NEAR BASE - A MOMENT LATER
An edgy TERRORIST all alone, standing watch.  Suddenly he's grabbed
from behind -- and THE COMEDIAN is holding the point of a BAYONET at
his throat.
COMEDIAN
Okay, Abdul.  Where's the bomb?
20. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
Everyone's slowly coming around.  By now CAPT. METROPOLIS has the
TERRORISTS tied up; he's consoling a squawling THREE-YEAR-OLD.
CAPT. METROPOLIS
Don't cry, little one.  You're in good hands.
(standing; to the crowd)
Now everyone.  Listen carefully.  We're going out through the torch.
He goes to a window, gives the thumbs-up sign to RORSCHACH out on the
torch.  RORSCHACH signals the OWLSHIP.
21. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - A MOMENT LATER
A METAL LADDER descends from the belly of the OWLSHIP.  RORSCHACH
secures it to the tip of the torch.
22.  INT. STATUE - MIDSECTION - THAT MOMENT
SILK SPECTRE and THE COMEDIAN marching up a long metal stairway.
SILK SPECTRE
Should be just overhead.  We have to distract them somehow . . .
COMEDIAN
Just barge in.  While they're staring at your tits we'll blow their
balls off.
They look up.  A TERRORIST is peering down at them from an overhead
landing.  The COMEDIAN lifts his rifle: thwip.  Before the terrorist
hits the floor, the COMEDIAN has lobbed a GAS GRENADE onto the
landing.
23. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - A MOMENT LATER
Gas everywhere.  The TERRORISTS' BOMB, and it's a big fat one, sits
in a complicated housing at the center of the landing, with
UNCONSCIOUS TERRORISTS sprawled all around it.  SILK SPECTRE and the
COMEDIAN, in gas masks, march up the stairs to scope things out:
COMEDIAN
Well.  They look distracted.
(turning to face her)
Don't suppose you know how to disarm one of these babies . . . ?
SILK SPECTRE
Eddie -- !
Suddenly panicked, she grabs his shoulder, points behind him.  He
turns.
One of the TERRORISTS still has some life in him.  He drags himself
over to the bomb and -- with his last ounce of strength -- FLIPS A
SWITCH on the housing.
A TIMER begins to count down.  Thirty seconds.  Twenty-nine.
COMEDIAN
SHIT!
He hits a trigger on his belt, and a RED SIGNAL LIGHT begins to
blink.  He spots an elevator door, runs over, and pries it open.  An
empty shaft; the car is some twenty stories below them.
SILK SPECTRE
What about the --
COMEDIAN
FUCK 'EM!
There's a mountain-climber's CARABINER on his belt; he fastens it
around the ELEVATOR CABLE -- and DROPS.  SILK SPECTRE hesitates only
a second before following suit.
24. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
CAPT. METROPOLIS is herding HOSTAGES down the stairway.  All at once,
he FREEZES.  There's a red SIGNAL LIGHT flashing on his belt as
well.
25. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
YET ANOTHER RED LIGHT is flashing on NIGHT OWL's instrument panel.
He looks up at VEIDT on the monitor.
NIGHT OWL
Adrian!
VEIDT
Yeah, I see it.  Mission aborted.
NIGHT OWL
Well, good God, we can't just --
VEIDT
Mission aborted, Daniel!
NIGHT OWL reluctantly agrees.  He lets out the throttle.
26. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - THAT MOMENT
On the BOMB.  The timer shows ten seconds to go.
27. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - A MOMENT LATER
The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE plummet downward, their BELT CLASPS
throwing off sparks against the cable.
28. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
CAPT. METROPOLIS at the window, petrified with fear, his hands
pressed to the glass.  He watches as the OWLSHIP flies away -- and
RORSCHACH, who's hanging onto the metal ladder, is YANKED BODILY off
the torch.
29. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT
THE COMEDIAN makes a hard landing on the roof of a car.  SILK SPECTRE
touches down behind him just as he manages to pry a set of elevator
doors open, and the two of them dive through.
30. AERIAL SHOT - MOVING OVER HARBOR - A MOMENT LATER
RORSCHACH clings desperately to the metal ladder as the OWLSHIP
streaks across the harbor.  Behind him is the rapidly receding figure
of Lady Liberty.
Three beats later, a GAPING HOLE blows open in her midsection.
31.  INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
A heartsick NIGHT OWL pounds the control panel in frustration.  On an
overhead monitor, the upper portion of the statue is TOPPLING.
32. INT. STATUE - A MOMENT LATER
Smoke everywhere.  The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE are pressed flat
against a CONCRETE BULKHEAD.  An overhang protects them from falling
DEBRIS -- which is raining down in copious amounts.
33. EXT. FERRY - A MOMENT LATER
The furious SWAT CAPTAIN watches in astonishment as the top half of
the statue disintegrates into RUBBLE and tumbles to the ground.  He
turns away from the sight, shaking his head in vehement disgust.
SWAT CAPTAIN
That's it.  I quit.
The water stirs.  The boat begins to ROCK.  On deck, all eyes turn --
34. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY
-- as a LUMINOUS BLUE-SKINNED GIANT, SIXTY FEET TALL, wades through
the harbor and steps up onto the island.  He stares in dismay at the
demolished statue . . . like a modern-day Colossus of Rhodes
wondering what the hell happened to his date.
Meet the last -- and most powerful -- member of our happy band: DR.
MANHATTAN.
Down below, THE COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE -- battered but intact --
are crawling out of the wreckage.  The COMEDIAN looks up at the huge
blue figure looming over them, and shakes a gnat-sized fist:
COMEDIAN
ASSHOLE!  WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!?
CUT TO:
35. INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT
The Channel 4 Newsroom, with anchors SHEILA SHEA and JIM BRADLEY.
SHEILA
In the face of mounting public pressure, the city of New York has
revoked its contract with Adrian Veidt's super-team.  Local police
have threatened a city-wide walkout if criminal charges against the
Watchmen are dropped.
On the bluescreen behind them, red circles with diagonal crossbars
surround SIX HEAD SHOTS of the individual WATCHMEN.
JIM
And in Washington today, the Senate introduced legislation which
would ban all costumed adventurers nationwide.  Easy passage
is expected.
(shuffling his papers)
Well, Sheila, it looks like the age of the superhero is officially
history.

TIMEPIECES of every description -- pocket watches, grandfather

37. EXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT
Darkened windows glow with the dim fire of reflected neon as we TILT
UP the towering facade of a forty-story apartment building.  A BLIMP

faint and dreamlike in the wind as we reach the penthouse -- where
heavy curtains flutter behind the ragged matte of a SHATTERED
PLATE-GLASS WINDOW.  SUPER TITLE:
NEW YORK CITY - TEN YEARS LATER
38. EXT. STREET BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A ramshackle NEWS KIOSK.  The OWNER, fat and stubbly, sits framed by
the garish covers of comic books and nudie mags, staring at the
high-rise across the street.  THREE POLICE CARS -- oddly truncated
bubble-shaped vehicles, recognizable from the flashing red beacons on
their roofs -- sit on the curb amid a throng of ONLOOKERS.
A CUSTOMER picks up a copy of the New York Gazette: ""NEW SKIRMISH ON
AFGHAN BORDER.  RUSSKIES WALK OUT ON PEACE POWWOW.""
CUSTOMER
Crazy reds don't know who they're messing with.
(indicating the cop cars)
What happened over there?
NEWS VENDOR
Some guy went sidewalk divin'  Twenny-five cents.
39. EXT. HIGH-RISE - STREET LEVEL - NIGHT
A riot of noise and color.  A plainclothes COP takes a statement from
the DOORMAN as PEDESTRIANS, clustered around an NYPD cordon, stare
with sickened expressions at a gruesome mess on the sidewalk.
PATROLMAN
STAND BACK!  MOVE ALONG!
We are not in New York as we know it; in this strange offshoot of
reality, everything -- the clothes, the cars, the very look of the
city -- seems just a touch off.  The PATROLMAN, for instance:
his standard-issue uniform consists of full riot gear, and his
plastisteel breastplate is festooned with heavy artillery.  He clears
a path for a squad of PARAMEDICS, who load a bloody parcel into the
back of a waiting ambulance.
DET. LT. BURNS climbs out of his car, squeezes through the crowd and
buttonholes his colleague, HYDE, the cop in charge of the
investigation.
BURNS
Had a lot of blood in him.
HYDE
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
BURNS
No idea who's behind this?
HYDE
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
BURNS nods once and stares up toward the penthouse window.
BURNS
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a
call from Washington.
HYDE
Washington?
BURNS
They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
HYDE, suddenly wide-eyed at this new development, stares off after
the ambulance as it merges with the northbound traffic.
40. EXT. STREET - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
TIGHT ON a large placard: ""THE END IS NIGH.""  The bearer of the sign,
a hunched STREET CRAZY in a ratty raincoat, plods up the sidewalk
spreading his message of cheer; his back is to us, but we can make
out an unruly shock of bright RED HAIR.
The NEWS VENDOR eyes him suspiciously as he passes, then turns up his
collar and looks pointedly away.  A SMALL BLACK KID, leaning against
the kiosk with a comic book, spots him too, and makes a quick,
cross-eyed face.  The STREET CRAZY lets out a low, hissing GROWL in
response and plugs on.
At the high-rise, a sanitation crew has just arrived to hose down the
sidewalks; RIVULETS OF WATER crisscross the street.  As the STREET
CRAZY wanders along,  he spots something unusual snagged in the rain
grate.
It's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON.  A tiny diagonal fleck of BLOOD stains its
surface, like the hand of a clock poised at twelve minutes to
midnight.
The STREET CRAZY bends to retrieve it.  He stares off at the
shattered window some forty stories above.
DISSOLVE TO:
41. INT. HIGH-RISE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
CAMERA DRIFTS from the penthouse elevator down a long, plush-carpeted
corridor.  The hallway is cordoned with thin plastic strips reading
""POLICE LINE -- DO NOT CROSS.""  At the far end is a single door,
SEALED OFF.
42. INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT
MOONLIGHT SHINES on an obstacle course of broken chairs and
overturned tables as we move inexorably toward the shattered picture
window.  At this altitude, the wind is fierce, and the curtains are
flapping wildly.
A ROPE drops into view.  A DARK SILHOUETTE lands on the ledge outside.
SHARDS OF GLASS crunch underfoot as this strange INTRUDER steps
inside.  He wears a slouch hat, a heavy trenchcoat; his face is
invisible to us as he snaps on a flashlight and sweeps it around the
room.
The apartment is, as promised, a slaughterhouse: smashed art prints,
gaping holes in the wallboard, and gallons of BLOOD everywhere.  The
flashlight beam shines on the front door, where THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS
and an electronic alarm system are still in place, undisturbed.
The INTRUDER turns suddenly.  His beam strikes the splintered remains
of a full-length WALL MIRROR -- and there, in the cracked and spiky
glass, we get our first good look at his face.  Or what passes for
his face.
He has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, nothing but a strange and
ever-shifting series of symmetrical patterns where his face should
be. . .a living, crawling inkblot on a luminescent field of white.
We've met him before.  He goes by the name of RORSCHACH.
43. INT. PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
RORSCHACH'S BEAM falls on the kitchen table.  HUNGRY FLIES walk
dainty-legged through a sticky puddle of congealing blood.
Offhandedly, he brushes the flies away; then he spots a SUGAR BOWL.
He tips it over, scoops up a handful of cubes, deposits them in his
trenchcoat pocket.
44. INT. PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
The beam shines across rumpled bedclothes, searches around the walls,
and settles finally on the half-open door to a walk-in closet.
RORSCHACH steps inside, examines rack upon rack of expensive
suits.
He shoves the suits aside.  Then, mysteriously, he begins to POUND on
the wall with his fist, moving left, right, up, down: THUMP.  THUMP.
THUMP.
He pauses.  He's found a hollow section.  He feels his way carefully
along the seams of the wall and floorboard until he discovers a
CONCEALED TRIGGER.  He presses it and a panel slides back, revealing
a SECOND, SECRET CLOSET, hidden inside the first.
He reaches up, flicks on a light.  Inside the secret closet: a
bizarre UNIFORM -- helmet, mask and gloves, a gaudy-colored bodysuit,
rows of exotic weaponry.  On the wall nearby hangs a dusty framed
PHOTOGRAPH.
RORSCHACH examines the photo.  It's a group shot, six men, one woman,
all dressed in similarly garish uniforms.  The man in the center is
wearing the costume on the wall before us. . .the COMEDIAN's
costume.
They're all there, all the Watchmen: NIGHT OWL.  SILK SPECTRE.  CAPT.
METROPOLIS.  DR. MANHATTAN.  ADRIAN VEIDT.  And of course, RORSCHACH
himself.  As he eyes this quirky memento of days gone by, we
DISSOLVE TO:
45. EXT. STREET CORNER - BROOKLYN - NIGHT
A LIGHT RAIN is falling as a weary figure emerges from a corner
store.  DANIEL DREIBERG, 44, thickset and bespectacled, walks with
the heavy gait of an athlete gone to seed.  He seems meek, defeated
-- old before his time.
He holds a hand to the skies, sets down his grocery bags long enough
to open an umbrella.  Then he turns down a deserted access street.
46. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT
In an alleyway just off the access street, there's a MUGGING in
progress: two young street toughs, their tinted hair tied up in
knot-tops, rolling a middle-aged man.  Across the street, DREIBERG
sees what's happening; it takes some effort, but he makes a conscious
decision to move on.  Then --
VOICE
Hold up, papa-san!
The KNOT-TOPS have emerged from the alleyway with their loot, and
spotted DREIBERG -- an unwanted witness.  Menace in their eyes, they
march toward him.  He sets his bags down and turns to face them,
almost welcoming the challenge; and suddenly, without warning, we
CUT TO:
47. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE
Slow-mo, double-frame, or sepia-tone; you call it.  But whatever the
gimmick, it should suggest that the events we're watching take place
in a stylized dream-time, midway between flashback and fantasy.
It's out old friend NIGHT OWL, duking it out with a gang of HOODS in
an alleyway not unlike the one we've just left.  There's a flurry of
fists; the HOODS topple, in quick succession--
-- and all at once a burst of BLINDING LIGHT BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME,
transporting us back to:
48. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT
Real-time again.  Our reverie's been interrupted by a SHAFT OF
WHITE-HOT LIGHT sweeping across the street, past DREIBERG, toward the
alley.
LOUDSPEAKER
HALT!  DO NOT TRY TO RESIST --
The KNOT-TOPS run for it.  DREIBERG shields his eyes against the
LIGHT -- which emanates from a POLICE HOVERCRAFT hanging in midair
some forty feet above his head.  The craft swoops off in pursuit of
the kids.
DREIBERG bends to retrieve his things and crosses to the mouth of the
alleyway.  He finds the old man slumped against a wall, obviously past
help.
49. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS slide back as DREIBERG lets himself in.  The
security system is almost as impressive as the one in the COMEDIAN's
apartment, but the decor is considerably less plush.
DREIBERG sets his bags on the floor, removes his raincoat, and hangs
it carefully in a closet.  Then he gathers his groceries, heads for
the kitchen -- and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS, confronted with a most
peculiar sight:
DREIBERG
. . . Rorschach.
50. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Leaning back in a chair, his feet propped up on the kitchen table, is
the aforementioned RORSCHACH.  His inkblot mask is rolled partway up,
exposing a mouthful of bad teeth, and he's calmly eating a plate of
baked beans.
DREIBERG
How did you get in here?
Ignoring the question, RORSCHACH greets him in a soft, rasping,
utterly emotionless whisper:
RORSCHACH
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
DREIBERG
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
DREIBERG is mildly panicked.  RORSCHACH -- who couldn't care less --
emits his trademark hissing GROWL.  He spoons more beans from a can
onto his plate, tops it all off with a generous squirt of ketchup
from a squeeze bottle.
DREIBERG (cont.)
I can't believe you're back on the streets.  Good God, man, you're
wanted on fourteen counts of murder.
RORSCHACH
At least six of those are trumped-up.  -- Here.
He reaches into his pocket, finds the HAPPY-FACE button, and flips it
to DREIBERG.  DREIBERG eyes it for a moment, automatically uses his
fingernail to scrape at the small red STAIN on its surface.
RORSCHACH (cont.)
Look familiar?
DREIBERG
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
RORSCHACH
Human bean juice.
(beat)
The Comedian is dead.
DREIBERG stares down at the button, suddenly getting the picture.
His jaw goes slack.
RORSCHACH (cont.)
Had a real nice place -- penthouse suite, forty stories up --
beautiful view.
Hope he enjoyed it on the way down.
DREIBERG
Jesus.  What.  A burglar . . . ?
RORSCHACH snorts: the possibility is too comical to consider.
DREIBERG (cont.)
Well, God, he'd been working with the CTU for almost a decade -- he
must've had enemies.
RORSCHACH
So do I.  So do you.
DREIBERG
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just
paranoia.
RORSCHACH's head jerks violently at the sound of the word.  DREIBERG
blinks involuntarily, half-expecting some kind of reprisal.  But
RORSCHACH merely stands, adjusts his mask, and starts toward the
front door.
RORSCHACH
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with
a grudge.
(pause)
Thought you might want to spread the word.
DREIBERG
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
RORSCHACH growls, shakes his head in disgust -- but complies.  He
opens the back door, pauses, turns to DREIBERG.
RORSCHACH
You the sentimental type, Daniel?  -- Brought you a souvenir.
He reaches into his trenchcoat and hands DREIBERG the framed photo
from the COMEDIAN's wall.  A moment later, he's gone.
DREIBERG sits down, unnerved.  As he reaches for the wall phone,
CAMERA ZEROES IN on a face from the photo: a blonde man, in a purple
tunic and mask . . .
51. INT. OFFICE SUITE - DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT
A GREAT SHADOWY JUNGLE CAT pads across acres of carpet.  The cat is
far from its natural habitat; in back of it is a glass-and-chrome
desk outfitted with a computer terminal, and at the terminal is
ADRIAN VEIDT, the brains behind the Watchmen.  Although he's
DREIBERG's age, his face is serene and unlined by worry.  Blond and
pale, he looks thirty.  When he's sixty he'll look forty.
VEIDT -- millionaire industrialist, and holder of over forty basic
patents -- is also something of an Egyptologist, and the decor of his
office reflects it: ancient vases sarcophagi, busts of Anubis, and the
like.  He keys a string of figures into the computer; the PHONE
RINGS.
VEIDT
Veidt here.
52. INTERCUT DREIBERG AND VEIDT
DREIBERG
Adrian?  Listen, it's Dreiberg.  I just had a visit from Rorschach.
I had to call you before he --
VEIDT
Daniel, slow down.  What's this about Rorschach?
DREIBERG
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
VEIDT
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
DREIBERG
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's
. . . I don't know, stalking us.
VEIDT
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
The big CAT purrs; it's a mutant lynx, genetically tailored, with red
fur and long, tufted, antenna-like ears.  VEIDT tosses the lynx a
chunk of raw meat from a platter on his deak while he ponders
DREIBERG's words.
VEIDT (cont.)
Daniel, Rorschach is insane.
DREIBERG
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells
blood.
VEIDT
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs
-- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
DREIBERG
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at
this late date.
VEIDT
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected
you.  Haven't I?
(slight pause)
Do you need money?
DREIBERG
No.  I just wanted you to --
VEIDT
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good
night.
DREIBERG
Good night.
VEIDT leans back in his chair, reaches for a gold case and extracts a
cigarette.  It's ""matchless""; you ignite it guy striking the tip of
the cigarette against the edge of the case.  He lights up and takes a
long, slow drag.
CUT TO:
53. EXT.  MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT
Barbed wire, armed GUARDS everywhere.  A vehicle waits at the
checkpoint; the GUARDS wave it through, and a huge cast-iron GATE
rolls into place behind it.  On the gate is a small, tasteful sign
which reads ""ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER.""
54. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT
ADRIAN VEIDT walks down a long, greenish corridor flanked by ARMED
ESCORT TROOPS.  At the end of the hallway is a foot-thick metal door
with a KEYPAD off to one side; one of the TROOPS punches in a
six-digit access code, and the door slides back to reveal . . .
. . . another door, this one outfitted with a simple
doorbell.  The TROOPS ring the bell, stand rigidly at attention, and
wait -- to VEIDT's great amusement.
The inner door slides open.  Peering out is an attractive, big-boned
woman in her mid-thirties: LAURIE JUSPECZYK -- aka the SILK
SPECTRE.
LAURIE
Adrian.
VEIDT
Laurie!  Good to see you.
She gives him a warm hug.  The ESCORT TROOPS march back down the hall
in perfect lockstep as the giant metal doors ease shut behind them.
LAURIE escorts VEIDT into a huge laboratory space: great oversized
machines, blinking computer terminals, advanced scientific
paraphernalia of every description.
VEIDT (cont.)
Nice.  Who's your decorator -- Edward Teller?
LAURIE
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
VEIDT
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
LAURIE
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
She takes his coat and vanishes into the living quarters.  VEIDT
wanders through the lab with an envious eye.  Suddenly he stops.  A
SMILE crosses his face as he gazes up at the ceiling:
VEIDT
Hi, Jon.
DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)
(a deep, booming voice)
Hello, Adrian.
DR. MANHATTAN -- Jon Osterman to his friends -- is a big guy under
any circumstances, but at the moment he's downright gargantuan.
Forty feet tall, bright blue and buck naked, he's calmly adjusting a
calibration atop his particle accelerator.
DR. MANHATTAN (cont.)
I think I'm about to detect a gluino.
In case you were wondering, this blue-skinned superman can do just
about anything.  He can manipulate matter effortlessly; the
physical universe is his plaything.  When it comes to the laws of
time and space, DR. MANHATTAN is a chronic offender.
Any government would be glad to have him.
VEIDT
Supersymmetrical theory, hmm?  Say, I understand old Schwartzmann
caught a decaying proton in that German mineshaft . . .
LAURIE, who's just reappeared, shakes her head and groans.
LAURIE
Please, you guys, no shop talk.
(to DR. MANHATTAN)
Jon, you're being rude.  Why don't you shrivel on down and join us?
DR. MANHATTAN shrugs and shrinks down to a somewhat more manageable
six-foot-five.  A pair of BLACK TRUNKS materializes about his waist
-- preserving his modesty.  Satisfied, LAURIE turns to VEIDT:
LAURIE (cont.)
Good to see you, Adrian.  What's the occasion?
He tosses a casual glance around the lab.  A number of VIDEO
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted on the walls.
VEIDT
. . . Are we being monitored?
DR. MANHATTAN looks at each of the cameras in turn.  One by one, the
little red ""ON"" lights wink out.
DR. MANHATTAN
The bearer of bad news.
VEIDT
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
LAURIE
Blake?  Dead?
DR. MANHATTAN
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the
funeral as a matter of protocol.
LAURIE shoots an irritated look at DR. MANHATTAN.  This is the first
she's heard about it.
VEIDT
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to
think that someone is ""stalking"" the Watchmen.
DR. MANHATTAN
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
VEIDT
What's your theory?
DR. MANHATTAN
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern
me.
VEIDT peeks at LAURIE, cocks an eyebrow: same old Jon.  But LAURIE is
considerably less amused.
LAURIE
I could use a drink.  How about you, Adrian?
VEIDT nods yes.  DR. MANHATTAN, meanwhile, has moved off to another
part of the lab.  He stands before a vast bank of machinery -- and as
we watch, a panel detaches itself from the front of the console and
floats off to one side.
A module of circuit boards, chips, and pin connectors slides out of
the hole.  Individual components detach themselves and HANG in
midair.  DR. MANHATTAN hasn't lifted a finger; he's dismantling and
reassembling his equipment through sheer force of mind.
VEIDT has seen these parlor tricks before.  He ambles up and resumes
the conversation without missing a beat:
VEIDT
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
DR. MANHATTAN
You mean Afghanistan?
(beat)
It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more
interesting.
The module, now fully reconstructed, slides back into place.  The
cover panel rises off the floor, settles over the hatch, and screws
itself shut.
VEIDT
Well . . . I wanted to bring you the news about Blake, but -- as
usual -- I can't tell you anything you don't already know.  Goodbye,
Jon.
DR. MANHATTAN nods -- just barely.  VEIDT heads for the door, finds
his coat where LAURIE put it.  He's just about to leave when she
arrives with two stiff drinks in hand.
LAURIE
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
VEIDT
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
LAURIE
Please.
There's a note of desperation in her voice.  VEIDT glances over his
shoulder at DR. MANHATTAN -- who's forty feet tall again, playing
with his superaccelerator.
VEIDT
He's a little farther gone every time.
LAURIE
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to
someone human.
(beat)
He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I
mean -- he even scares the research teams.
VEIDT
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed
the world.
LAURIE
(embarrassed)
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's
doing his work --
VEIDT
What about you?
LAURIE
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.
(pause)
I'll ring for the guards.
She goes to the steel door, hits a buzzer.  VEIDT watches her,
concerned.  She COUGHS, violently, and he reaches into his vest
pocket for a cigarette case:
VEIDT
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.
(handing her a cigarette)
Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give
Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
LAURIE
Maybe I'll do that.
VEIDT
I'm sorry about Blake.
He pats her on the shoulder.  The door slides open and the TROOPS
appear to escort VEIDT back down the hallway.
LAURIE takes a long pull on her drink and gazes up at her superhuman
lover.  He tinkers with his equipment; then, satisfied, he turns and
WALKS THROUGH A SOLID BRICK WALL -- as if it weren't there.
CUT TO:
55. EXT. HAPPY HARRY'S - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
A decrepit waterfront bar in a particularly rough neighborhood,
popular with denizens of the underworld, accessible by a narrow
stairway which dips well below street level.
56. INT. HAPPY HARRY'S - NIGHT
The usual crowd, living it up.  HOOKERS line the bar.  DRUG DEALERS
hover at the entrance to the men's room.  ASSORTED GOONS AND THUGS
stand clustered at the pool table, watching a TOPLESS DANCER bump and
grind.  Suddenly there's a terrible RACKET, and everyone TURNS.
Over by the entrance, RORSCHACH is hard at work ripping a PAY PHONE
off the wall.  Once he has it on the floor, he gives it a couple of
vicious licks with a crowbar; then he strides casually over to the
bar -- where the proprietor, HAPPY HARRY, is nervously polishing
glasses.
RORSCHACH
Harry.
HARRY
(petrified)
R-Rorschach.
RORSCHACH
Phone's out of order.  Mind if I use yours?
He reaches under the counter, sets a phone on the bar.  RORSCHACH
picks it up and FLINGS IT at a nearby table, scattering the PATRONS
and yanking the cord cleanly out of the wall.
He turns and faces the assembled multitudes:
RORSCHACH
Edward Blake.  Friend of mine.  Fell through a window.  Might've had
help.
(wandering through the room)
Thought maybe you could fill me in.
ENORMOUS TOUGHS sit riveted to their chairs, staring up in horror as
RORSCHACH strolls past.
RORSCHACH (cont.)
You.  Gideon.  Whoremonger.  Nothing?
(moving on)
Johnny Gobs.  What's new at the schoolyard?
Behind RORSCHACH's back, a shadowy figure is slinking furtively
toward the exit.  RORSCHACH pivots suddenly, grabs him by the collar,
yanks him off his feet and slams him into a wall.
RORSCHACH (cont.)
Nicky the Jap.  In a hurry?  You keeping secrets, Nicky?
NICKY sits slumped against the wall, quaking with fear.  RORSCHACH
extends a hand to help him up.  He reaches out hesitantly --
-- and RORSCHACH grabs him by the wrist, pulling him off balance.  He
closes a gloved fist around NICKY's pinky finger, twists it back and
SNAPS IT.
RORSCHACH (cont.)
Edward Blake.  Who killed him?
No answer forthcoming.  NICKY lets out a horrible moan as RORSCHACH
grabs his index finger and repeats the process.
RORSCHACH (cont.)
Who killed Edward Blake?
NICKY passes out.  RORSCHACH releases his grip, lets NICKY sink to
the floor, and reaches for his crowbar.  He's standing poised to let
fly at NICKY's ribs when a VOICE IN THE CROWD shouts out.
VOICE
JESUS!  HE'S IN SHOCK!!
RORSCHACH
THE COMEDIAN.  WHO KILLED HIM?
By now HARRY's pulled a sawed-off shotgun from underneath the bar.
Without looking up, RORSCHACH spins and HEAVES THE CROWBAR.  It
catches HARRY in the jaw, pitching him back into a rack of
glassware.  The SHOTGUN discharges TWO HARMLESS BLASTS into the
ceiling.
SILENCE in the bar as the ONLOOKERS await RORSCHACH's next move.  He
looks at the bleeding HARRY, shakes his head in disgust:
RORSCHACH (cont.)
So many vermin . . . so little time.
He bends, pulls a topcoat off NICKY's quivering frame, and tosses it
contemptuously at the NUDE DANCER.  Then he turns to go, pausing long
enough to HISS at the crowd:
RORSCHACH (cont.)
Go back to your heroin and your child pornography.  I'll be
around.

CUT TO:
57. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - LIVING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN
The bedroom which LAURIE shares with DR. MANHATTAN at the Rockefeller
research complex.  It's not quite six A.M., still dark outside, and
LAURIE is asleep.  She tosses around under the covers, reaches over
to where DR. MANHATTAN should be -- but his side of the bed is
empty.
LAURIE
(muttering; groggy)
Jon . . . ?
A LUMINOUS BLUE HAND enters frame, strokes her cheek gently.  LAURIE
closes her eyes and sighs.
DR. MANHATTAN
I'm here, Laurie.
LAURIE
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
DR. MANHATTAN
Not yet, there's plenty of time.
A SECOND BLUE HAND strokes her hair.  LAURIE stretches luxuriantly.
DR. MANHATTAN kisses her softly on the throat.
LAURIE
Mmm.  You feel so good.  Do you have to go?
The BLUE HAND runs down the length of LAURIE's shoulder and arm,
toward her hip.  She sighs dreamily.
DR. MANHATTAN
Would you like me to stay?
LAURIE
Mm hmm.
DR. MANHATTAN
I could stay and go.
LAURIE
. . . And just how would you manage that?
She leans up to kiss him.  The SECOND BLUE HAND continues its
downward progress, almost colliding with a THIRD blue hand, which is
massaging LAURIE's thigh.
Third blue hand?  Wait a minute.  LAURIE's eyes go suddenly
wide.  She sits bolt upright in bed.
DR. MANHATTAN is stretched out beside her.  He is also sitting at the
foot of the bed.  There seem to be two of him.
LAURIE
AAAAAAAAAA!!
DR. MANHATTAN I
Laurie?  Are you --
DR. MANHATTAN II
Don't be upset.
This unique menage a trois proves a bit much for LAURIE's
fragile nerves.  She climbs angrily out of bed and reaches for a
dressing gown.
LAURIE
Jon, please.  I don't enjoy these tricks.  Just -- be one
person again, please?
The big blue twins stand up, spreading their hands in identical
gestures of apology as LAURIE stalks past.
DR. MANHATTAN I
Laurie, I did it to please you.  I thought --
DR. MANHATTAN II
-- you would find it erotic.
LAURIE
All right, all right.  It's just -- my nerves, I'm going stir-crazy
in this place, I --
While fumbling in her purse for a cigarette, LAURIE happens to glance
through a doorway, into the lab outside.  To her utter astonishment,
she sees a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN out there, calmly running an
experiment on one of his oversized toys.  She marches angrily through
the door . . .
58. INT. LAB - A MOMENT LATER
. . . to confront DR. MANHATTAN number three:
LAURIE
You've been out here all along, haven't you?  Running one of your
stupid experiments --
DR. MANHATTAN III
Yes, I thought I could finish up before I leave for Washington.
LAURIE
So you sent your, your proxies in there to -- Jon, really, how
could you do this?
DR. MANHATTAN III
You seem to feel I've been neglecting you.  Isn't that the case?
(pause)
I thought I'd solved the problem quite elegantly.
LAURIE
That's all it is to you, isn't it?  Just another problem you
can --
She doesn't see the other two DR. MANHATTANS, who have just entered
the room behind her.  They speak in perfect unison:
DR. MANHATTANS I & II
Laurie, please --
LAURIE pivots, lets out a little squeal of shock.  She turns back
slowly, steadies herself on a lab table.
LAURIE
Jon -- just go to Washington, all right?  And take them with you.  I
could really use the time alone.
She storms back into the living quarters, past DR. MANHATTANS I &
II -- who pop out of existence as soon as she passes.  The original
DR. MANHATTAN cocks an eyebrow, sighs, and returns to his
equipment.
FADE THROUGH TO:
1. INT. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT
A pricey joint in midtown.  DREIBERG and LAURIE, well-fed, are hard
at work on their second bottle of wine.  She looks amazingly
beautiful in full makeup and low-cut evening gown -- but it's largely
wasted on her preoccupied date.
At the moment, she's filling him in on life with Dr. Manhattan:
LAURIE
The government's really worried.  He gets so flaky sometimes.  I
guess it's no picnic being the world's only superhuman.
(mock-macho)
I have to keep him in line.
She flexes her bicep and holds the pose, waiting for DREIBERG to
laugh.  He doesn't.  In fact, he barely even notices; his gaze has
wandered off into a far corner of the room.
LAURIE (cont.)
Excuse me -- where exactly are you tonight?
DREIBERG
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think
anyone's out to get us -- do you?
LAURIE
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no
Mother Teresa.
DREIBERG
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
LAURIE
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the
government or do time.
DREIBERG
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty
tricks -- political assassinations --
Now he's got LAURIE nervous.  She scans the restaurant quickly, then
leans forward and speaks, in hushed tones:
LAURIE
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us
made other choices.
DREIBERG
(shaking his head in disgust)
Yeah.  That pig Blake gets buried at Arlington, full military honors
. . . and I'm still in the psycho file with Rorschach.
LAURIE looks at him a moment.  She starts to chuckle.
DREIBERG (cont.)
What's so funny?  Have I got food in my teeth?
LAURIE
I'm just wondering what you would've said ten years ago if you could
see yourself right now.
(raising her glass)
Well, here's to the Comedian.  'Cause the fact is, he's dead . . .
and we're not.
DREIBERG makes a face -- and smiles despite himself.
1. EXT. ROOFTOP OUTSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE have repaired to the romantic rooftop terrace,
which overlooks the Manhattan skyline.  They're holding big snifters
of brandy, and they're both pretty well drunk.
DREIBERG
The pisser is, nobody ever remembers all the good shit we did.  I
mean, we were heroes!
LAURIE
Damn straight.
DREIBERG
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
LAURIE
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
DREIBERG
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the
world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
LAURIE
(smiling)
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma?
What was his name . . .
DREIBERG
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd
beat him up?
LAURIE
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
DREIBERG
(deadpan)
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an
elevator shaft.
LAURIE looks aghast for a second and a half.  Then her hand goes to
her mouth -- and like DREIBERG she's GIGGLING helplessly.  CAMERA
PULLS UP AND AWAY, isolating them on the rooftop, and we hear a
stentorian VOICE over scene:
CHAPLAIN (V.O.)
In the midst of life we are in death . . .
CUT TO:
59. EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY
AN AMERICAN FLAG lies across the coffin of Edward Blake.
CHAPLAIN
. . . and so we commend our brother Edward Blake unto God, who shall
change our vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body --
TIGHT ON DR. MANHATTAN, standing at graveside amid a tight know of
mourners.  There's no weeping, no gnashing of teeth;  most of the
attendees are bureaucrats or military men, obviously here for reasons
of protocol.  Nearby is a cadre of riflemen, ready to send Blake off
with the traditional twenty-one gun salute.
CHAPLAIN (cont.)
-- according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all
things unto himself.
A light rain begins to fall; umbrellas open all around.  DR.
MANHATTAN, of course, doesn't need one -- the raindrops vanish
miraculously before they strike him.  CAR HORNS sound in the
distance, and he glances off at:
60. EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CEMETERY - THAT MOMENT
SENTRIES stand at attention.  They've blocked off the part of the
cemetery where the funeral is taking place, but the good Doctor has
been spotted nonetheless, and word of his presence is spreading like
wildfire.
MOURNERS and TOURISTS are rushing in from every corner of the
cemetery to get a look at the bright blue superman.  With all due
respect for the dead, Arlington National's turning into a zoo:
gawkers are lined up three or four deep.  The sentries have their
hands full managing the crowd.
A KID breaks free from his parents and sprints across the graves to
join the excited throng.  As he does, our attention settles on the
VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL.
It's not the familiar stark black wall.  It is, bizarrely, a chiseled
marble representation of DR. MANHATTAN; his eyes are turned skyward,
and he's cradling a WOUNDED AMERICAN GRUNT in his massive arms,
Pieta-style.  On the pedestal beneath it, a bronze
plaque bears the inscription:
IN MEMORY OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS
WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES
TO ACHIEVE VICTORY IN VIETNAM
Below it are the names of the American dead.  There are almost four
hundred of them.
61. EXT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT
The Rockefeller Military Research Center -- LAURIE's home sweet
home.  Her car pulls up to the guard's booth and he waves her
through.  As soon as the chain-link gate rolls back into place behind
her, the GUARD picks up a phone and punches in a number.
62. EXT. RESEARCH CENTER - NIGHT
LAURIE strides up a concrete walkway at the entrance to the complex,
fumbling in her purse for a mag-striped ACCESS CARD.  She inserts the
card into a slot at the door.  Nothing happens.
She tries again.  Still no luck.  Just then, a long black car pulls
up behind her -- and a uniformed officer, MAJOR ADAMSON, steps
out.
LAURIE
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
ADAMSON
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
LAURIE
Why?  What's the problem?
ADAMSON
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
LAURIE
(chuckling)
I would like to use the bathroom --
As she speaks, TWO ARMED GUARDS come marching up the walkway.
ADAMSON
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
LAURIE
What?!
ADAMSON
Please.
The major puts a firm hand on her elbow and leads her off.  The
GUARDS stand at attention, then fall in behind them as they pass.
ADAMSON holds the car door open.  LAURIE's climbing inside when she
sees something which turns her confusion into outright panic.
The entrance to the research center has just opened -- and emerging
from it, onto the walkway, are a half-dozen men in FULL RADIATION
SUITS.
63. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT
LAURIE enters with full military escort.  The troops hand her off to
a team of DOCTORS and LAB TECHNICIANS, then drop back to stand guard
at the door.  A brusque NURSE presents her with a short white
gown:
NURSE
Miss Juspeczyk.  Put this on, if you would.
LAURIE
What -- ?
DOCTOR
Drink this.
The DOCTOR hands LAURIE a glass full of iridescent green fluid.  She
stares at it, still somewhat nonplussed.
DOCTOR
Drink it.
64. INT. MEDICAL LAB - ANTEROOM - NIGHT
TECHNICIANS monitor a series of computer screens.  On the screens are
shifting, multicolored GRAPHICS PATTERNS representing the interior of
a human body as seen from a variety of angles.  A leaded window opens
on:
65. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT
We're watching what looks like an electronic sarcophagus.  A
donut-shaped housing traverses its length repeatedly, head to foot,
foot to head, sending a three-dimensional readout telemetrically to
the anteroom.
Through a glass panel in the sarcophagus we see LAURIE, he head
wedged into a fixed metal brace, eyes darting fitfully left and right
as she wonders just what the hell is going on.
66. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT
A MAN'S HAND slides a photograph across a table.
LAURIE (O.S.)
That's Col. Brent Dabbs.  Jon's military liaison.
LAURIE, still dressed in the white gown, is seated at a table
surrounded by GOVERNMENT AGENTS in three-piece suits.  Chief Agent
SCHMIDT nods at his cronies and replaces the photo with another taken
from a thick sheaf.
LAURIE (cont.)
Dr. Candelaria.  He works on one of Jon's research teams.  The
quantum-whatever.
SCHMIDT lays a third photo before her.  It's a group shot of the
Watchmen -- the same picture that hung in BLAKE's closet.  LAURIE
hesitates.
LAURIE (cont.)
That's Jon.  Obviously.  And me.  Adrian Veidt.
(long pause)
Rorschach . . .
SCHMIDT
Their real names, please.
LAURIE
I don't know their real names.
SCHMIDT
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
LAURIE
I don't know their real names!
SCHMIDT
You're not ""protecting"" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on
the answers you give.
(holding up the sheaf of photos)
These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
LAURIE
Then why don't you ask him?!?
Furious, she pushes herself away from the table and moves to a nearby
window.  The AGENTS exhange cool glances.  Like all experienced
torturers, they understand the value of patience.
LAURIE (cont.)
I want to get dressed.  -- And I'd like a cigarette.
One of the AGENTS pulls a pack from his coat, shakes a cigarette out
for LAURIE.  As he's lighting it -- a perfect gentleman -- the door
opens and a LAB TECHNICIAN enters with a clipboard.
He passes the clipboard to SCHMIDT, who examines its contents -- and
tilts an eyebrow.  LAURIE, looking on, is about to burst with
curiosity:
LAURIE (cont.)
Someone had better tell me what's going on here!
SCHMIDT
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file
are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else
in common as well.
(beat)
They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
LAURIE
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
All at once, the obvious hits home -- and LAURIE's face goes
bone-white.  SCHMIDT nudges the clipboard toward her.  Trembling, she
takes it. . .then sets it down, staggered by what she's read.
SCHMIDT
I'm terribly sorry.
LAURIE
What does this mean?  What does it --
SCHMIDT
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can
see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
LAURIE
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible
joke to make me --
She scans the room.  No one's laughing.  SCHMIDT gets up, signals to
his comrades, and heads for the door.
SCHMIDT
Take a day or two.  If you ""remember"" any names . . . do give us a
call.
The AGENTS leave, and LAURIE sits alone in the office.  She reaches
for the clipboard and takes another long hard look.  Then, quaking,
she buries her face in her hands.
67. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
A darkened room just off the office; LAURIE is visible through a
two-way mirror.  The door opens, and MAJOR ADAMSON -- who's been
watching all along -- is joined by SCHMIDT.
ADAMSON
Poor kid.
SCHMIDT
We'll keep her in isolation awhile.  She'll give us some names.
ADAMSON
To hell with those costumed idiots.  I'm worried about Doc
Manhattan.
SCHMIDT
What do you mean?
ADAMSON
She's his last link to humanity.  Once she's gone . . . God knows
which way he'll jump.
DISSOLVE TO:
68. INT. HOTEL ROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY
DR. MANHATTAN stands in front of a full-length mirror.  He's wearing
a navy-blue double-breasted suit, a white shirt, and a maroon necktie
with an irregular mauve pattern.
The tie doesn't quite suit him.  His brow wrinkles, and the tie
magically transmutes into a more sedate wide-red job with diagonal
gold stripes.
Too staid.  DR. MANHATTAN frowns, and the tie transforms itself into
a handsome royal-blue number with tiny hydrogen atoms for
decoration.
It does nice things for his complexion.  Satisfied, he turns from the
mirror, starts for the door, and DEMATERIALIZES.
69. INT. TELEVISION STUDIOS - DAY
TECHNICIANS running to and fro.  A harried DIRECTOR checks the green
room, where the STAFF is beginning to panic.
DIRECTOR
We're on the air in five minutes.  Where the hell is
that big blue son of a --
He stops, wisely, in mid-sentence.  DR. MANHATTAN has just
rematerialized inside the studio, two feet from the DIRECTOR's
face.
DR. MANHATTAN
I'm sorry.  Am I late?
DIRECTOR
No problem.  We'll have to head straight for the set.  -- Oh, I'm
Kent Turner, the director. . .
The DIRECTOR shakes DR. MANHATTAN's hand and marches him down a
hallway.  Within seconds they're joined by a GOVERNMENT LIAISON.
LIAISON
Dr. Osterman.  I've got a list of taboo areas here we'd like you to
steer clear of.  Obviously, Afghanistan will come up, but if you'll
just play it cool --
DIRECTOR
Doc, that blue of yours tends to wash out on camera.  Could you give
us something a little darker . . . ?
DR. MANHATTAN pauses briefly.  His skin tone darkens two shades.
DR. MANHATTAN
Will this do?
DIRECTOR
Perfect.
LIAISON
Now Doc, please -- on this Afghanistan thing --
But the good doctor is already at the edge of the set, surrounded by
a cluster of SOUND MEN, PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS, etc., who are
hurriedly prepping him for the telecast.  The frustrated LIAISON
hangs back and glances up at an OVERHEAD MONITOR.  The ""ABC NEWS
SPECIAL REPORT"" graphic is already onscreen, with THEME MUSIC
underneath.
70. INSERT - TV MONITOR
Stock footage.  We open on a shot of terrified Viet Cong racing for
their lives through a dense jungle; the camera WHIP PANS to the right
and takes in an extraordinary sight.
A towering, ninety-foot tall DR. MANHATTAN strides blithely through
the jungle, occasionally directing a blast from his fingertips at the
greenery below.  AMERICAN HUEYS hover behind him, spitting out bursts
of automatic fire, performing mop-up duty as this one-man defoliation
crew does his apocalypse thing.  A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads:
""VIETNAM.  1965.""
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Dr. Manhattan: the nuclear titan spawned in a freak scientific
mishap.  For more than twenty years the ""Manhattan Option"" has been
the linchpin of America's conventional strategy --
We CUT to PRAGUE, where RUSSIAN TANKS are rolling through a broad
thoroughfare.  DR. MANHATTAN, only forty feet tall this time, rounds
a corner and emerges from behind a municipal building.
His EYES gleam eerily, and the lead tank begins to HEAT UP, the grey
gunmetal turning red before our eyes.  The hatch springs open, STEAM
hisses, and TERRIFIED RUSSIAN SOLDIERS clamber out -- only to be met
with a barrage of ROCKS thrown by the local citizenry.  Title reads:
""CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  1968.""
ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)
-- in trouble spots from Vietnam to Czechoslovakia to Nicaragua: a
one-man cavalry coming to the aid of our democratic allies, holding
the Communist menace in check.
DANIEL ORTEGA, in Sandinista drabs, sits at a table across from
American Secretary of State G. Gordon Liddy.  The two men shake
hands, hold up a signed treaty for the camera.  DR. MANHATTAN, in a
three-piece suit, stands behind them, presiding over this historic
accord.  Title: ""NICARAGUA.  1979.""
ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)
In the famous words of General William Westmoreland, ""Yes, Virginia,
there is a Superman -- and thank God, he's American.""
71. INT. SOUNDSTAGE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
A sparse, businesslike talk-show set: two chairs, a table, a backdrop
of the Washington monument, and a gallery full of MEDIA PEOPLE.  Jaded
news vet DAVID BRINKLEY is manning the host's chair:
BRINKLEY
For this live question-and-answer session we'll be joined by
correspondents from all three networks.  But since I am moderating,
I'll ask you to keep your questions short and snappy.
(turning)
Now let's welcome our special guest, Jonathan Osterman . . . better
known to the world as Dr. Manhattan.
Applause from the crowd.  ANGLE WIDENS to include Doctor M, seated at
BRINKLEY's right.  He nods in acknowledgement.
BRINKLEY (cont.)
I suppose the topic on everyone's mind this week is Afghanistan,
where Russian tanks appear to be poised for a massive invasion.  Now
since you've dealt successfully with similar situations in the past .
. . I'll ask you point-blank: has the administration requested that
you intervene?
DR. MANHATTAN
I will not intervene in Afghanistan.
A HUBBUB goes up among the crowd.
72. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON
Looking on from offstage.  He rolls his eyes in frustration.
73. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN
HANDS are already shooting up among the NEWSMEN in the audience.
BRINKLEY ignores them:
BRINKLEY
You're saying you would refuse a direct request?
DR. MANHATTAN
There will be no request.  I will not intervene.
BRINKLEY
Well, Doctor, it's widely understood, or rumored, that you can
actually see the future.  Does you answer indicate that the
hostilities in Afghanistan will blow over?
74. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON
He's steamed, but like everyone else in the studio he's hanging on
DR. MANHATTAN's every word.  He turns apprehensively to a COLLEAGUE
in the shadows behind him -- and snaps his fingers once:
LIAISON
I want a phone line to the booth.  Now.
75. ANGLE ON BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN
DR. MANHATTAN
I see the future only as it relates to me.  I have no control over it.
(long pause)
I can only repeat . . . that there will be no request. . .and I will
not intervene.
He sits there like a big blue Buddha.  BRINKLEY shrugs and presses on.
BRINKLEY
Well, then -- I hope we can take that as an optimistic sign.  I'll
open up the floor to questions now.  Doug?
REPORTER
Dr. Osterman, I'm Doug Roth of Nova Express.  I'd like to read
you some names:  Col. Brent Dabbs, Dr. J. M. Candelaria, Wallace M.
Weaver . . . do these names have any meaning to you?
DR. MANHATTAN
All friends, yes.  Associates of mine.
ROTH
Let me go on.  Stephanie Boris, William Charles Batts, Susan White.
Are you aware that these ""friends"" and ""associates"" of yours have all
been diagnosed with terminal cancer?
The CROWD NOISE begins to build.  Even BRINKLEY's taken aback.  He
gapes at DR. MANHATTAN -- who sits there silently, his inhuman face
an unreadable mask.
76. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON
eyes wide, hand cupped over the in-house telephone
LIAISON
Oh Jesus.
(barking into phone)
I want this broadcast killed.  I'll run out on that goddamn set if I
have to!
77. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY, ROTH, DR. MANHATTAN
ROTH
I have here an official list of sixteen names, all similarly
diagnosed.  Now, for the record, Doctor -- is there a
connection?
By now, the crowd is about to erupt -- ROTH is shouting to make
himself heard over the din.  BRINKLEY, who's just gotten a message
from the booth, touches his headset and announces:
BRINKLEY
I'm told it's time for a break.  We'll be back after this brief
message --
Within seconds the MILITARY LIAISON has rushed out onto the set,
flanked by two COLLEAGUES in mirrorshades.
LIAISON
THAT DOES IT!  NO MORE QUESTIONS!  SHOW'S OVER!!
The three of them all but yank DR. MANHATTAN out of his seat.  Then,
PANDEMONIUM breaks loose as eager NEWSMEN bolt the gallery and MOB
THE SET.
RANDOM NEWSMEN
Dr. Manhattan!  Are these allegations true?  Do you cause
cancer??
DR. MANHATTAN
I don't wish to answer any questions.
RANDOM NEWSMEN
You see the future!  Did you know in advance --
LIAISON
The Doctor will not answer your questions.  Now STEP
ASIDE!!
The LIAISON and his boys form a wedge in front of DR. MANHATTAN, but
the mass of bodies and microphones is all but impenetrable.
RANDOM NEWSMEN
How long have you known -- why is the government concealing this
information --
DR. MANHATTAN
Please get out of my way.
The LIAISON throws an elbow, knocking a REPORTER to the floor.
SCUFFLING breaks out.  Just as it's getting vicious, DR. MANHATTAN
lets out a THUNDEROUS SHOUT:
DR. MANHATTAN
I said LEAVE ME ALONE!!
In the wink of an eye, the soundstage is EMPTY -- no newsmen, no
microphones, no cameras -- nothing but the lone figure of DR.
MANHATTAN and, still sitting in the chair behind him, BRINKLEY.
BRINKLEY swallows hard and fidgets with his necktie.  A moment later,
there's an ANGRY FLASH of WHITE LIGHT -- and DR. MANHATTAN VANISHES,
leaving BRINKLEY alone on the deserted set.
CUT TO:
78. INT. RESEARCH CENTER - LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT
The place has been pretty well torn apart; MAJOR ADAMSON is
overseeing a crew of technicians in white suits as they post
quarantine notices at the entrances.  He's not altogether surprised
when DR. MANHATTAN rematerializes at his side.
DR. MANHATTAN
Where's Laurie?
ADAMSON backs off slightly.  He's not wearing a radiation suit, and
he's understandably reluctant to get any closer than absolutely
necessary.
ADAMSON
She's been relocated, Jon.  It's strictly precautionary . . .
DR. MANHATTAN
There's no need to lie.  I assume she's been tested.  Were the
results positive?
ADAMSON hesitates the briefest of seconds.
DR. MANHATTAN (cont.)
Don't bother.  I already know what you'll say.
He watches impassively as what's left of his home is dismantled.  His
mind is already a million miles away.
ADAMSON
Jon, I know this is presumptuous, but . . . if you wanted to . . .
could you cure her?
DR. MANHATTAN
I don't know.  I only know that I won't.
(long pause)
There'd be no point.  It's finally begun.
ADAMSON
""Begun?""  What's begun?
DR. MANHATTAN
I've seen this day.  It's the day I've been dreading all these years.
(pause)
You see, Major Adamson, Laurie Juspeczyk was the only human being I
cared for . . .
ADAMSON doesn't know what he's talking about, but a chill runs down
his spine nonetheless.
DR. MANHATTAN
My work here is finished.  God be with you, Major.
And with that, he VANISHES.  His double-breasted suit he leaves
behind; it hangs in midair for a moment, then crumples into a pile at
the Major's feet.
ADAMSON
Good Lord --
CUT TO:
79. EXT. OUTER SPACE
-- and it's about as exterior as you can get.  We're a few
hundred miles above Earth; the curvature of the globe is readily
apparent from this height, and the surface looks placid and eerily
beautiful
-- oceans and continents overlaid by a pattern of shifting white
clouds.  From frame right, a BLUE FIGURE swings into view, eclipsing
our planetary vista and disappearing again off frame left.
It's DR. MANHATTAN.  He's in a lotus position, sitting on
nothingness, calmly scanning the globe from his orbital vantage.
Stars twinkle behind him as he looks down on the planet he's about to
leave, his normally-inscrutable features tinged with regret.
80. EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - NIGHT
Black sky hangs over an empty stretch of desert -- so desolate, so
barren and otherworldly that it could pass for Mars.  Could, that is,
until we see the residue of man's presence on the landscape: ruined
quonset huts, roofless, long since abandoned to the elements,
half-buried in drifts of sand; military vehicles, little more than
husks now, rusty and gutted; and a sign, dangling awkwardly from a
rotted upright -- GILA FLATS TEST BASE.
A gecko skitters across the sand and pauses.  Above it, a sudden
RUPTURE appears in the night sky, bathing the sands in blinding blue
light.  The gecko runs wildly as DR. MANHATTAN steps through the rift
in the sky and descends gently to earth.
The rupture heals itself, and the desert is dark and peaceful once
more as DR. MANHATTAN trudges through the sands toward the ghost town
of Gila Flats.  He wanders through the ravaged doorway of what was
once a canteen: tables are overturned, bottles broken, but the long
mahogany bar, though pitted and scarred, stands intact.
A desert rat scurries down its length as DR. MANHATTAN looks on.  We
MOVE IN on his emotionless glowing EYES and
DISSOLVE TO:
81. INT. CANTEEN (FLASHBACK) - DAY
It's twenty-odd years ago, and we're looking at DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN
-- a big, boyish, clean-cut guy of twenty-six, dressed in a necktie
and a white lab coat.  He's at a table sipping a mug of beer, wearing
a dopey smile as he gazes out of frame at his lunch companion:
JANEY SLATER (O.S.)
Nineteen million for the intrinsic field disruptor.  You'd think they
could at least make us a decent hamburger.
JON laughs, looks sheepishly down at his hands.  He's utterly smitten
with DR. JANEY SLATER, his colleague at the test base; she's a couple
of years older than he, and pretty, in a heavily-coiffed way -- just
close enough to LAURIE that you'd notice the resemblance.  And she's
probably the only one in the room who can't see just how bad a crush
JON has on her.
JON
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna
head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
JANEY
With lots of ketchup?
Smiling, she indicates JON's plate.  He's emptied at least half a
bottle on his french fries.
JON
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
JANEY
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug
like you doing in a place like this?
JON
Anything for science, I guess.
(long, hesitant pause)
Janey, there's something --
JANEY
(simultaneously)
We should get back --
(realizing she's cut him off)
What?
JON
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
JANEY
We should get back to the lab.
(staring at him; chuckling)
You okay, Jon?
He stares at his hands, afraid to meet her eyes.  After a moment he
pipes up:
JON
Oh, yeah.  You go ahead.  I'll be right behind you.
The lad seems a little screwy today.  JANEY shrugs, gets up and heads
for the door.  JON takes a moment to collect himself, then looks after
JANEY.  She's paused in the doorway to unbuckle her wristwatch.
His face goes a little pale.  He screws up his courage, rushes up
behind her.
JANEY
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
JON
(blurting it out)
Janey, will you marry me?
She turns and looks him squarely in the face.  He's wearing the
pained expression of a convicted murderer waiting to hear the
verdict.
JANEY
Jon -- what?
JON swallows hard, and the two of them stare at each other, eyes
locked.  For a moment it's as if they're the only souls in the
canteen.  But just then two SCIENTISTS come bustling through the
door, clipboards in hand, deep in a conversation of their own; and
one of them -- DR. WALLY WEAVER -- walks smack into the startled
JANEY, causing her to drop her wristwatch.
There's a loud CRUNCH.  JON and JANEY snap out of their private
trance as WALLY bends to retrieve the watch.
WALLY
Christ, Janey, I think I stepped on your watch.
JANEY
Oh Wally, don't feel bad.  It was cheap, it never worked anyway --
JON
I can fix it.
JANEY
-- What?
JON
My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better
than ever.
He holds out his hand.  Their eyes meet for a long moment.
WALLY
Take him up on it.  It'd make me feel better.
Chuckling, WALLY and his colleague head off to find a table.  JANEY
hands JON the watch; his hands close around her, and he gazes at her
with basset-hound eyes.  She realizes he's still waiting for his
answer.
But before she can speak, JON produces a small BOX from his pocket.
He thrusts it abruptly into JANEY's hands --
JON
Here.  I'll trade you.
-- and hustles off.  She opens the box, finds an ENGAGEMENT RING.
With a little smile she tries it on, and turns to show JON -- but
he's already gone.
She stares at the ring.  Her smile broadens.
82. INT. LABORATORY - DAY
JON's at a lab table, papers stacked all around him.  In the center
of the table is a piece of black velvet strewn with JEWELER'S
TOOLS.
It's his lunch hour, and he's fixing JANEY's watch.  He tightens the
central screw which holds the hands in place, then fits the crystal
into its housing and gives it a light tap.
With a big, childlike grin of satisfaction -- the boy's in love,
remember -- he gets up and starts for the door.  The lab is jammed
with oversized, arcane machinery; the centerpiece is a concrete TEST
CHAMBER with two-foot-thick metal walls.  Mounted on either side of
it are PARTICLE CANNONS -- great bulky devices which look like
anti-aircraft guns encircled by huge plexiglass coils.
He stops, spots his lab coat hanging on a peg in the corner, and
walks over to grab it.  As he's putting it on, he hears a tiny SQUEAK
from the direction of the test chamber.
Mounted above the chamber is a DIGITAL CLOCK -- hours, minutes,
seconds, tenths of seconds.  Just now it's 13:58 and change.  JON
eyes the clock, hesitates briefly, then grabs a broom and steps to
the reinforced steel door of the chamber.
Inside, the chamber is empty but for a concrete block mounted on a
low platform -- and a MOUSE, which scurries into the corner when it
hears JON coming.  He steps inside, sets JANEY's watch on the
concrete block, and swings the broom at the mouse.
JON
C'mon, little guy, outta here . . .
The mouse legs it out the door.  JON follows, smiling, broom in
hand.
JON (cont.)
. . . don't wanna screw up a million-dollar experiment.
He stops.  Feels around in his pocket.  Realizes he's left the watch
inside.
He looks at the overhead clock again -- 13:59:30 and counting.
Agitated now, he races back toward the chamber, pauses in the
doorway, spots the watch resting where he left it on the far side of
the concrete block.  He dashes inside, circles around the concrete
block, reaches for the watch --
-- and FREEZES at the sound of THREE WARNING BEEPS behind him.
White-faced, he snatches at the watch and ducks around the concrete
block -- too quickly.  He nicks his shin on the projecting edge of
the support platform and tumbles to the floor of the chamber.
Before his eyes, a MASSIVE STEEL DOOR is sliding into place --
TRAPPING HIM INSIDE.
He LURCHES toward the door, gets a hand through.  The door keeps
sliding.  He jerks his hand back a half-second before the door slams
shut.
83. INT. LAB - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT
1300 hours sharp.  A half-dozen SCIENTISTS stroll into the lab.  One
of them is passing out goggles -- to his colleagues and a pair of
MILITARY BIGWIGS who are obviously on a walking tour of the
facilities.
SCIENTIST
-- actually, we don't know what happens when you disrupt the
intrinsic field.  All we've managed to do so far is blow a few
concrete blocks all to hell.
GENERAL
(joking, but worried)
No danger of . . . fallout, is there?
SCIENTIST
No sir.  The chamber's radiation-proof once it's sealed.  That's why
we waited outside.
The translucent coils on the particle cannons have begun to glow a
dull red.
The crowd draws closer, goggles in place.  There's a dim, distant
THUMPING.
The SCIENTISTS look at the chamber -- and go slackjawed in perfect
unison.
GENERAL
What's the matter?
SCIENTIST
Sweet Jesus -- !
We DOLLY IN rapidly on the observation panel mounted inthe wall of
the test chamber -- leaded glass, two feet thick.  Behind it is the
terrified face of JON OSTERMAN -- pounding frantically on the glass,
screaming soundlessly.
Pandemonium in the lab as the SCIENTISTS rush right and left,
punching buttons, twisting knobs -- to no avail.  The GENERAL comes
to a belated and painfully obvious realization:
GENERAL
Say, there's a man in there!!
The coils on the cannons have gone from red to bright yellow.  One
SCIENTIST stands at the observation window and SHOUTS --
SCIENTIST I
Stay calm, Jon!  We'll try and kill the power!
-- while another barks furiously into a wall phone:
SCIENTIST II
Building six!  Kill the power!  Osterman's trapped in the I.F.
chamber!!
The GENERAL stands there looking rather nonplussed.
GENERAL
Well -- why doesn't someone let him out??
SCIENTIST III
It's a timelock.  It can't be opened once the sequence
starts.
(to SCIENTIST II)
What's the word?
SCIENTIST II
(covering the phone)
They're sending a crew to the generator building --
SCIENTIST IV
TWENTY SECONDS!
In a glass box on the wall is a fire ax -- with the instructions ""IN
CASE OF FIRE BREAK GLASS.""  WALLY WEAVER, Jon's friend from the
canteen, wraps his lab coat around his forearm, punches through the
glass, and grabs the ax.
SCIENTIST I
Wally!  What are you doing?
WALLY
The power cables!!
And now another figure enters the lab -- the unsuspecting JANEY
SLATER.
JANEY
Am I late for the --
She stops in midsentence at the sight of the frenzied action in the
lab.  SCIENTIST III spots her, grabs her, tries to push her back
through the door.
SCIENTIST III
Janey!  Get her out of here.  Get out!
But she resists.  She's just spotted WALLY with his ax, poised to
take a swing at a thick black cable on the floor.  The cannon coils
have just gone from yellow to a brilliant, luminous white.
JANEY
What in the name of -- where's Jon?
SCIENTIST III
Janey!  Please!  Go!!
WALLY strikes at the cable.  Nothing.  He takes another whack, and a
sudden jolt of current knocks him off his feet and throws him into a
wall.
Sparks fly, but the process continues.  The room is full of white
light.  JANEY, fighting her way past the SCIENTIST, gets a good look
at the observation panel -- and the blood drains from her face.
JANEY
Jon.
84. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT
JON backs away from the glass panel, a look of disbelief on his
face.  He blinks; his hands fall limply at his sides; the watch,
which he's been holding all along, falls on the floor and shatters .
. .
. . . and everything in the room goes blue.
85. INT. LAB - THAT MOMENT
The SCIENTISTS slowly cluster around the observation panel, unable to
tear their eyes away.  JANEY, past hope, wanders up unsteadily behind
them.
JANEY
Jon . . .
(shrieking)
JON!!!
86. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT
JON's back is arched.  His arms go up.  His face is a mask of
unbelievable agony.
A moment later, his skin is gone.  A black skeleton -- like a
photographic negative -- stands in his place.
Then the skeleton BURSTS. . . into its constituent atoms.  The
iridescent blue light has quite literally taken Jon Osterman to
pieces.
And then, the test chamber is empty.  The blue light begins to dim,
and we're looking through the window panel at the stagger faces of
the SCIENTISTS.  One by one, they back away . . . leaving only JANEY,
who gazes into the chamber with a blank, soulless stare.
DISSOLVE TO:
87. INT. RUINED CANTEEN (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT
The desert rat chitters on the bar.  On the partially collapsed wall
behind it hangs a broken clock, which stopped some twenty years ago
at 11:48 PM.
For a moment DR. MANHATTAN, even more abstracted than usual, watches
the rat.  Then he turns and walks through more drifted sand out the
door of the canteen.
88. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN walks aimlessly through the rubble of the compound.
89. INT. MEN'S ROOM (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
TWO SCIENTISTS washing their hands at the sinks.  They glance up into
the mirror simultaneously, and BLANCH.  Behind them, a hideous
thing is coalescing in midair -- a brain, eyes, a dangling spinal
cord, wriggling neurons -- a gruesome, disembodied central nervous
system.
They pivot, shrieking, just in time to see the creature evaporate in
a haze of shimmering blue light.
90. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.
91. EXT. TEST BASE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
HORRIFIED SENTRIES fire their rifles, then turn and run.  A
partially-muscled skeleton stands by the perimeter fence and SCREAMS
for several seconds before vanishing altogether.
92. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.
93. INT. GILA FLATS MESS HALL (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
Dinnertime.  JANEY and WALLY at a table.
JANEY
I can't help it.  I'm going to quit this place.  It feels . . . it
feels haunted.
WALLY
It'll be all right, Janey.  You need time, that's all.
(tugging at his ear)
Do you hear some kind of -- whistling?
Indeed she does, and within moments it builds to a deafening whine.
Odder yet, WALLY's hair is standing on end -- and so is JANEY's.
Everyone in the mess hall seems to be experiencing the same freakish
phenomenon.
UTENSILS rise from tables and drift magically into the air.  Without
warning, the overhead lights blow out -- and a BRILLIANT BLUE GLOW
suffuses the room.  All eyes turn toward the source of the glow . . .
. . . the fully formed figure of DR. MANHATTAN, floating above them,
nude, hands spread like some majestic blue messiah.  Metal trays and
utensils hover in midair around him, throwing off sparks.
JANEY gapes at his face.  She recognizes it instantly.  Her hands go
to her mouth and she lets out a horrible, endless shriek.
JANEY
JON-N-N-N!!!
DISSOLVE TO:
94. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
THE SHRIEK DIES as DR. MANHATTAN stares up into space.  He turns,
stares at the ground.  Nothing but sand.  He stoops nonetheless and
begins to dig.
A couple of inches down, he finds what he's looking for: an ancient,
tattered photograph, faded almost beyond recognition.  Young Jon, and
Janey Slater.  She's holding up her hand, showing off her brand-new
engagement ring.
His fist close around the snapshot.  His eyes slowly shut.
95. SERIES OF SHOTS
Quick, almost subliminal visions of the past and future:
-- JON's black skeleton, bursting to atoms in the test chamber;
-- JANEY shrieking in the mess hall, her face bathed in blue
light;
-- LAURIE at a breakfast table, drinking coffee, reading the paper.
There's a sudden flash of light; the windows shatter inward; a
terrible blast of heat chars the skin off her bones . . .
-- A CITY demolished by a nuclear blast, the inevitable mushroom
cloud rising swiftly, blotting out the sky.
96. EXT. DESERT - ON DR. MANHATTAN
Fists still clenched, he stands -- grimacing, distraught, alone in
the ghostly calm of the desert.  He rises into the air, slowly at
first, then faster . . . finally disappearing in a sudden blue
starburst a mile above the ground.
97. EXT. OUTER SPACE
All at once, we're back in the starry void, hurtling away from Earth
at unimagined speeds . . . through empty space, past the moon, on
toward Mars.
The red planet looms larger and larger, finally dominating the frame
as we descend toward the chaotic terrain of the Martian surface.
Individual features of the landscape grow gradually more distinct:
vast canyons, oceans of fog, volcanoes the size of Missouri.
Herschel's famous canali.  And finally, the argyre
planitia, an enormous shallow crater, its rocky rim encircling
two jutting blue mountains and, to the south, a ragged, semicircular
ridge.
Two eyes, a big broad smile.  It looks uncannily like a
happy-face.
Many miles below us, a tiny rupture opens in the Martian
atmosphere.  BLUE LIGHT spills out an instant before we
CUT TO:
98. INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN
The late news, with highlights of DR. MANHATTAN's press conference.
As the throng of REPORTERS shove microphones at him, we ZOOM IN on
his angered face:
DR. MANHATTAN
I said leave me alone!!
Then there's a sudden CUT.  We see the same REPORTERS, in the same
positions, only DR. MANHATTAN is gone -- and they're all standing on
the White House lawn, in the midst of a torrential downpour.
PULL BACK TO:
99. INT. ROOM - GOVT. SECURITY COMPLEX - NIGHT
A restless LAURIE watching the broadcast from an overstuffed chair.
She's in a big open room with a bed and kitchenette; except for the
big metal door and the bars on the windows, it could pass for a comfy
furnished studio.
TV ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.)
-- in Washington, where an irate Dr. Manhattan teleported
a crew of reporters into the midst of a rainstorm on Pennsylvania
Avenue!
TV ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
Well, Katie, I know some politicians who'd like to learn that trick --
LAURIE turns at the sound of keys in the door.  A moment later,
SCHMIDT enters, followed by a pair of FEDERAL AGENTS.
SCHMIDT
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
LAURIE
Am I free to go?
SCHMIDT
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move
it.
LAURIE
(fed up; exploding)
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit
--
SCHMIDT
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan
border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living
soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic
weapons has finally flipped out.
LAURIE
Jon??  You mean he's --
SCHMIDT
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard
has apparently left the planet.
CUT TO:
100. EXT. NEWSTAND - DAY
The same headlines scream from every edition on the rack:
DR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH
Russian Tanks Advance
President Vows ""Maximum Force""
WHERE IS DR. MANHATTAN?
And on the street, tensions are running high.  The familiar NEWS
VENDOR is engaged in a heated exchange with one of his CUSTOMERS:
NEWS VENDOR
I'll tell you what the problem is.  We shoulda been building tanks,
bombs, ICBM's!  Instead we been relying on that big blue son of a
bitch --
CUSTOMER
Anyone ever tell you you're full of shit?
NEWS VENDOR
Kiss my ass, buddy!  Keep your goddamn quarter!
VOICE
New Frontiersman, please.
The NEWS VENDOR turns suddenly, finds himself confronted by an old
friend: the red-haired STREET CRAZY with the end-of-the-world sign.
He rolls his eyes -- this is all I need -- and reaches under
the counter.
NEWS VENDOR
Here you go, pal.  Two bucks.
(beat)
Well, I see the world ain't ended yet.
The STREET CRAZY eyes the lurid cover of his magazine.  ""EXPOSED: RED

STREET CRAZY

101. EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
A row of decayed walk-ups in a fringe neighborhood downtown.  A
DRUNKEN COUPLE -- a gaunt, middle-aged MAN and a blowsy, overweight
WOMAN -- totter down the street arm in arm.  NEON SIGNS blink on and
off as they mount the front steps of a seedy building, exchanging
tipsy giggles.
102. INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT
A three-room hellhole, decor by Goodwill.  A door opens, and the MAN
ushers his date inside with exaggerated formality.  Her name is LUCY;
his is Edgar William Jacobi, but -- for reasons soon to be revealed --
we'll call him MOLOCH.
MOLOCH
Now.  What was milady drinking?
LUCY
Gin.  Straight up --
(mock-ladylike)
-- with a little twist of lime.
She laughs convulsively, as if she's just told the world's funniest
joke.  MOLOCH lifts a single finger and starts toward the kitchen:
MOLOCH
I think I can oblige.
103. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
MOLOCH FREEZES in the doorway, his face taut with apprehension.  The
contents of his refrigerator have been strewn all over the kitchen
floor -- overturns milk cartons, broken eggs, the like.  It's a
disaster area.  As he steps inside to investigate, LUCY appears in
the doorway behind him -- and SNORTS.
LUCY
Jeez, honey!  You got some kind of animal in here?
On cue, the refrigerator door KICKS OPEN -- and out pops RORSCHACH.
He grabs MOLOCH by the lapels, pins him back against the kitchen
table.
RORSCHACH
Moloch.  Did you miss me?
LUCY
Willie!  Jesus!  What's going on?
RORSCHACH
(glancing up)
Who's the welfare mother?
MOLOCH
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong
guy.
RORSCHACH
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
MOLOCH
You're making a big --
RORSCHACH lifts MOLOCH up slightly, then slams him down hard against
the table -- repeatedly, to the beat.
RORSCHACH
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
MOLOCH
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
LUCY
Willie, what's he talking about?
RORSCHACH backs off, allowing MOLOCH to slump to the floor.
RORSCHACH kneels beside him.
MOLOCH
Look, I don't know what you want, but I been a private citizen for
ten years.  I --
RORSCHACH cups one gloved hand under MOLOCH's chin and pulls him
close.  Then, for LUCY's benefit, he explains:
RORSCHACH
Turned state's witness in '75.  Earned himself a brand-new face.
(twisting MOLOCH's head to one side, for a better look)
Hnnrh.  Butt-ugly then . . . butt-ugly now.
He shoves MOLOCH back onto the floor, then stands.  There's a sugar
bowl on the table; RORSCHACH spots it and pockets a few cubes as
MOLOCH gets up to dust himself off.
RORSCHACH (cont.)
Comedian dead.  Dr. Manhattan in exile.  Obvious connection.  Who's
behind it?
MOLOCH
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with
--
RORSCHACH
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
MOLOCH
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
RORSCHACH
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
LUCY, still unsettled, crosses to MOLOCH's side and grips his arm as
RORSCHACH opens a rear window.  He's climbing through the frame when
he stops suddenly and points a finger at the frightened pair:
RORSCHACH (cont.)
Word of advice for the lady . . . stock up on penicillin.
-- and he's out on the fire escape and GONE.  LUCY looks suspiciously
at MOLOCH, who shrugs, embarrassed: I don't know what he's talking
about.

104. INT. PENTAGON - WAR ROOM - DAY
The familiar set from Dr. Strangelove: top brass seated at a
big round table, with a huge Mercator-projection map of the world
looming in BG.  The Afghan-Pakistani border is highlighted in red; a
MILITARY ANALYST paces in front of the big board with a penlight
POINTER,
highlighting areas of strategic importance.
ANALYST
Our projections show Pakistan falling within the week.  From there
it's sixty percent certain they'll try to take Western Europe.
GENERAL
Respectfully, sir, out NATO allies are getting itchy.  They're
quizzing us about the possibility of a first strike.
MOVE IN on a tall chair at the head of the table -- the back of which
bears the seal of the President of the United States.
PRESIDENT
First strike.
(long pause)
I'd like to view the simulation.
The ANALYST hits a button on a remote control device.
ANALYST
Optimally . . . we could expect to wipe out some eighty percent of
their retaliatory capability before they knew what hit 'em.
On the big board, BLUE ARROWS emanate from selected points in the
Pacific and the Arctic Circle and veer toward Russian turf --
blossoming in yellow-and-black RADIATION
SYMBOLS as they strike their targets.
PRESIDENT
What about our end?
ANALYST
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that
twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
On the board, RED ARROWS inch westward from Mother Russia.
ANALYST (cont.)
Britain down -- Germany down --
PRESIDENT
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
ANALYST
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified
command bunker at the time of the launch order.
RADIATION SYMBOLS sprout over New York, Baltimore, Washington,
Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco.
PRESIDENT
. . . Of course.
By now, both coasts are pretty well blotted out.  The ANALYST, a
dedicated optimist, turns to announce:
ANALYST
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the
farm belt.
PRESIDENT
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . ""nuclear winter""
theory?
ANALYST
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . .
may depend on a quirk of the weather.
PRESIDENT
The weather.  I see.
(pause)
Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum
strike conditions.
The SECRETARY OF STATE -- our old pal G. Gordon Liddy -- pipes up:
SECRETARY LIDDY
Dick, before we act hastily, we should consider . . . Dr. Manhattan
may decide to return.
With a heavy heart, the Chief Executive pushes himself away from the
table -- and we get our first good look at him.  His face is lined
and tired, his hair is flecked with white, but he's none other than
that beloved statesman RICHARD M. NIXON -- still vital and robust at
74.
PRESIDENT (cont.)
Good God.  At times like this I wish I'd never come out of
retirement.

105. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY
A private practice in midtown Manhattan.  LAURIE emerges from an
examination room, grim and hollow-eyed; the DOCTOR hangs back in the
doorway.
DOCTOR
I'm sorry, Miss Juspecyzk.
LAURIE
Not at all, Doctor.  I appreciate your honesty.
106. INT. GUNGA DINER - DUSK
A greasy Indian restaurant in a Village storefront.  In a booth near
the entrance we find LAURIE and DREIBERG munching on chicken
tandoori.
DREIBERG
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a
couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .
(pause)
How about you, Laurie?
LAURIE
(lying -- with forced cheer)
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the
hell out.
(shrugging)
No expense account.  No place to live.
DREIBERG
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each
other, someone might put two and two together . . .
LAURIE shakes her head and laughs -- mirthlessly.
LAURIE
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're
right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the
Watchmen.
DREIBERG
Maybe not, but why take chances?
LAURIE
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent
all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel --
I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own
life, and --
-- and she's dying of cancer.  The irony of it hits home, throws a
damper on her little burst of optimism.  Depressed again, she starts
to get up.
LAURIE
I'm just running on, Dan.  Thanks for dinner.  I'd better go find
myself a cheap room.
DREIBERG watches on, paralyzed by indecision, as LAURIE heads for the
door of the restaurant.  Then, submitting to impulse, he gets up and
chases her down:
DREIBERG
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . .
.
LAURIE
Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
DREIBERG
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely
right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
LAURIE
You're sure?
He nods.  She smiles and takes his arm as they walk out of the
restaurant.
THROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby booth we watch them passing on the
street outside.  The OCCUPANT of the booth, whose face is out of
frame, fidgets restlessly with a menu and a squeeze bottle of
ketchup.
He inverts the ketchup over the menu, squirts out an upside-down
question mark, then closes the menu and mashes it shut.  When he
opens it again, he's got a makeshift RORSCHACH BLOT.
107. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GUNGA DINER - SUNSET
A SHORT-ORDER COOK empties garbage into a can outside the restaurant,
then disappears inside.  Two beats later, a DARK SILHOUETTE strolls
casually down the alleyway.
He moves a garbage can, finds a sheet of plywood tacked to the
crumbling brick wall behind it.  He pries the plywood loose, finds a
small recess in the wall, then extracts a SLOUCH HAT . . . and a
shifting INKBLOT MASK.
108. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The guest bedroom is furnished in a somewhat grandmotherly style:
flowered wallpaper, an old brass bed with a frilly comforter, etc.
It's small but cozy, and LAURIE lets out an appreciative ""aah"" as
DREIBERG ushers her in.
LAURIE
This is so nice of you, Daniel.  I really do appreciate it.
DREIBERG's lugging her suitcases.  He sets them on the bed and stands
there for a moment, looking vaguely expectant.
LAURIE (cont.)
Are you . . . waiting for a tip?
DREIBERG
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I
mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
LAURIE
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really
sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
She gives him a sisterly peck on the cheek, then returns to her
unpacking.  DREIBERG watches her for a second, then turns to go.
109. INT. HALLWAY - ON DREIBERG
As he closes the door, he get a quick glimpse, from behind, of LAURIE
unbuttoning her shirt.  He quickly averts his gaze and pulls the door
shut.
110. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
DREIBERG, in pajamas, climbs into bed and kills the light.  He folds
his hands behind his head and stares up at the ceiling.
111. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE
Another quick glimpse of derring-do.  This time it's SILK SPECTRE --
LAURIE -- in the midst of a gang of thugs.  She fights them off
valiantly, but she's heavily outnumbered.  She turns and runs.
An oblong shadow falls across the ground, and NIGHT OWL swings into
frame; he's clinging to a rope ladder which hangs from his AIRSHIP
overhead.  In one smooth motion he swoops into LAURIE's path and
snatches her into the air, safe from the clutches of her pursuers.
112. INT. BEDROOM - ON DREIBERG.
His head turns at the sound of WATER running in the bathroom
adjacent.  He's going to be awake half the night thinking of
LAURIE.

113. EXT. STREET - DAY
Early morning.  Across the street from us is a BUBBLE CAR parked in
an alley.  Its occupants: MOLOCH, and a straitlaced guy in a suit and
crewcut.  He's got a definite CTU look about him.
MOLOCH gets out, scans the street, and crosses toward the GUNGA
DINER.
114. INT. GUNGA DINER - REST ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
A twitchy MOLOCH locks himself in a stall, sits on the throne, and
pulls out a bundle of WHITE POWDER.  He takes a couple of hits up the
nose, then dips his finger in the stuff and rubs it around the edges
of his EYELIDS.
His eyes water.  He sniffles.  He reaches for some toilet paper;
bizarrely, a small BUSINESS CARD falls out of the roll.  He picks it
up . . .
There's a hand-scrawled RORSCHACH BLOT on its face.
A low, hissing GROWL from overhead.  MOLOCH looks up suddenly -- and
sees RORSCHACH peering at him over the stall partition.
He GASPS and lunges for the door.  RORSCHACH's arm snakes out and
holds the stall door shut.
RORSCHACH
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational
drugs.
MOLOCH
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got
something for you.
A long pause.  RORSCHACH GROWLS again: let's have it.
MOLOCH (cont.)
There's a big bunch of research scientists -- missing.  Blake was on
a case, trying to track 'em down.
(beat)
It's big, Rorschach.  Something to do with Doc Manhattan.  That's all
I've been able to find out.
RORSCHACH
Drug habit.  Highly illegal.  Hnrrh.
(snarling)
Let it go time.  In future -- just say no.
With that he disappears over the edge of the stall.  MOLOCH sits
there a moment.  He reaches for the stall door, rattles it.  It won't
open.
MOLOCH
HEY!!
RORSCHACH's stuck a broomstick through the door handles on the
adjacent stalls. As MOLOCH POUNDS on the door in frustration, we

A plush RECEPTION ROOM in his Veidt Industries pyramid; it's
decorated in the same Egyptian motifs as his office.  VEIDT sits in
an overstuffed chair, surrounded by VIDEO CAMERAS; he's in the
process of charming JUSTINE JAMES, a fawning Barbara Walters-figure
who's prepping a segment for her next celebrity-chat special.
JUSTINE
Now Adrian, I guess there's one thing everyone wants to know.
Are you the world's smartest man?
VEIDT
Oh my, yes.  And the best-dressed.
A round of chuckles from the video CREW.  Wotta smoothie!
JUSTINE
You're certainly one of the richest.  Holder of over forty
basic patents -- including products that have changed our everyday
lives.
(pause)
If you had one achievement you were proudest of -- what would that be?
VEIDT ponders for a second, then reaches into his jacket and pulls
out his gold cigarette case.
VEIDT
Sphinx brand.
(opening the case)
When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . .
humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good
in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco,
that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs
as you smoke it?
(lighting up)
In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
JUSTINE
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your
old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
VEIDT
(bristling)
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the
Watchmen.
JUSTINE
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
VEIDT
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
VEIDT is interrupted by a GROWLING NOISE from his office adjacent.
He glances quickly over his shoulder, then gets back to business.
VEIDT (cont.)
-- we agreed specifically --
MORE GROWLING from the next room over.  The CAMERA CREW's getting
curious.  VEIDT gets up from his chair.
VEIDT (cont.)
Excuse me a second.
He goes to the office door and slips inside.  The usually-smiley
JUSTINE shoots a look of disgust at her CREW: what a prick.
116. INT. VEIDT'S OFFICE - DAY
VEIDT is shocked to find RORSCHACH down on the carpet, wrestling with
his mutant LYNX.  He CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE:
VEIDT
KITTY!!
One last nip, and the cat backs off.  RORSCHACH gets to his feet --
no visible signs of damage, except for a severe bruise to his
dignity.
VEIDT (cont.)
How the hell did you get in here?
The curtains are flapping; a BREEZE hits VEIDT across the face.  He
looks up, sees a NEAT ROUND HOLE cut out of his plate-glass
window.
RORSCHACH
New information.
VEIDT
(pointing to the telephone)
Ever see one of these before?
RORSCHACH
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked
up.
VEIDT
What is that ungodly smell?
RORSCHACH, abashed, lets out a timid version of his trademark
HISS.
RORSCHACH
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
VEIDT
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a
roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.
(beat)
And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us
all look bad.
RORSCHACH
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad
press.
He makes for the window.  VEIDT frowns, adjusts his tie and exits.

117. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE cooking dinner.  DREIBERG burns his fingers on a
broiling pan, which prompts a sudden round of stamping and
cursing.
LAURIE watches for a minute, then shakes her head.  She pours a full
glass of wine and thrusts it at him.
LAURIE
Daniel -- drink this.  Immediately.
(smiling)
I swear, you are acting like a kid on a date.
Sucking on his burnt fingers, he reluctantly takes the wineglass.
DREIBERG
Okay, I'm nervous.  It's an odd sensation.  I've always had to think
of you as Dr. Manhattan's --
He catches himself -- too late.  LAURIE glowers at him.
LAURIE
His what?
DREIBERG
His . . . whatever.
LAURIE
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
She spears a couple of steaks, drops them on plates, and heads toward
the dining room.
LAURIE
Look, I just want to eat dinner and get drunk.  Let's not make it any
more difficult than we have to, huh?

A DINING ROOM TABLE littered with crumpled napkins and dirty
dishes.  DREIBERG and LAURIE have just finished dinner.  He stares in
dismay at the TV screen as he opens a fresh bottle of wine.
DREIBERG
Good Lord.  With Jon out of the picture it's a whole new ball
game.
LAURIE's already a little tipsy, and the broadcast doesn't much
interest her.  Wine glass in hand, she's wandered over to the stereo
cabinet.
LAURIE
That's right, Daniel.  A whole new ball game.
(smiling)
God!  I haven't seen on of these in fifteen years.
She's referring to DREIBERG's ancient TURNTABLE.  Shelved beneath it
are row upon row of LP's -- these days, they're obsolete collector's
items.
DREIBERG
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I
listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
LAURIE
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.
(flipping through records)
Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these
people.
DREIBERG
Play one.  Educate yourself.
LAURIE chuckles.  Her head turns at the sound of a familiar
COMMERCIAL THEME.  On the TV, a young woman sits at her vanity and
gazes lovingly at a WEDDING PICTURE framed in silver.
LAURIE
Oh look.  It's Adrian's ad.
TV CHORUS
""Oh my darling, it's incredible,
That someone so unforgettable . . .""
120. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT
MOLOCH's apartment.  THE SAME COMMERCIAL is blaring from the TV as
RORSCHACH lets himself in.
TV CHORUS
"". . . Should think I am unforgettable too.""
RORSCHACH
Moloch?
No reply from MOLOCH, who sits in an easy chair, his back to camera,
seemingly glued to the tube.  RORSCHACH casts a cautious glance
around the room and advances stealthily toward the chair.  Onscreen,
the WOMAN at the vanity opens a jar and smear LIME-GREEN GOO on her
face:
TV ANNOUNCER
The years melt away with NOSTALGIA.  Use it once a week -- and
wrinkles vanish overnight.  Medically tested, non-habit-forming
NOSTALGIA is the patented beauty cream that actually reverses
the aging process . . .

Moloch?
He creeps up behind MOLOCH, lays a hand on his shoulder.
121. REVERSE ANGLE - ON MOLOCH
staring at the TV screen with sightless eyes.  There's a NEAT ROUND
BULLET-HOLE in the center of his forehead.  RORSCHACH sees it and
spins on his heels, anticipating an ambush --
TV ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
For the smooth young face he'll never forget --
122. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
LAURIE is still flipping through records.  DREIBERG chuckles at the
TV ad.
TV ANNOUNCER
-- turn back the clock with NOSTALGIA . . . from Veidt Industries.
DREIBERG
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
LAURIE
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm
thirty-eight years old!
DREIBERG
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide
it?
LAURIE
I like the way you look.
(beat)
It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change.
But you, Daniel, you look . . .
DREIBERG
Old?
LAURIE
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.
(standing up)
Here, you pick one.
DREIBERG
. . . What?
LAURIE
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
Her tone is unmistakably flirtatious.  DREIBERG hesitates -- then,
with a noncommittal smile, he moves to the record cabinet.
123. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT
RORSCHACH making a hasty exit.  An AMPLIFIED VOICE booms out:
LOUDSPEAKER
RORSCHACH!  THIS IS THE CIVIL TERRORISM UNIT.  YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE TO
COME OUT.
He goes to the window and peeks through the blinds.  On the street
outside, BUBBLE CARS are massing, blocking off the intersection.  A
CTU SWAT TEAM prepares to raid the building.
LOUDSPEAKER
YOU WON'T BE HARMED.  COME OUT.  IT'S ALL OVER!
He's walked into a trap.  As he lets the blinds fall, ALL SOUND DIES
-- and a bouncy, tinkling PIANO THEME comes up underneath.
124. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The PIANO MUSIC emanates from DREIBERG's stereo: an old Fats Waller
tune, ""S'posin'.""  He's slow dancing with LAURIE, their faces
illuminated by the cold blue flicker of the television.  With a smile
she reaches up to remove his glasses, then deposits them in his shirt
pocket.
Dreamily, she rests her hand on his shoulder.  Her nearness is making
him nervous.  She pauses in mid-step and takes his face in her
hands.  He tries to look away, but she pulls his face around -- so
that he can't avoid her gaze any longer -- and plants a soft kiss on
his mouth.
The PIANO INTRO ends, and Fats' teasing vocal begins:
""S'posin' I should fall in love with you . . .
Do you think that you could love me too . . .""
125. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)
SONG CONTINUES UNDERNEATH, cheerful soundtrack accompaniment to a
horrific silent movie.  RORSCHACH races out of the bathroom carrying
a plastic MOP BUCKET, plus an armload of bottles and aerosol cans --
ordinary household supplies.  He enters the kitchen, rummages around
under the sink, finds another handful of bottles: cleaning fluid,
rubbing alcohol, Drano.
Almost as an afterthough he moves to the gas stove, turns on all the
burners -- and BLOWS OUT THE FLAMES.
""S'posin' I should hug you and caress you . . .
Would it impress you . . .""
126. INT. TENEMENT - FRONT STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS)
A contingent of ARMED CTU MEN rushing silently up the stairs.
""Or would it distress you?  Hmm?""
127. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT (MOS)
RORSCHACH dousing the living room carpet with charcoal lighter and
rubbing alcohol.  There's a pile of bottles -- only half-emptied --
resting next to the front door.  The CTU COPS are pounding on the
front door, trying to break it down.  RORSCHACH crouches in the
hallway just outside the living room.
The door finally gives way, and the COPS tumble in.  RORSCHACH
strikes a match and holds it to the nozzle of an AEROSOL CAN --
creating a minature FLAMETHROWER.  The COPS heads swivel just as the
puddle on the carpet catches -- and a moment later, the PILE OF
BOTTLES EXPLODES, engulfing the doorway in flame.
""S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .
(Yeah I yearn.  Sure I do.)
Would you think I'm speaking out of turn? . . .""
128. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE horizontal on the sofa, their clothes in
disarray.  LAURIE kisses him hungrily -- but he's distant, panicky,
unable to respond.  It's been a long time for him.  It's not going
well.
""S'posin' I declare it
Would you take my love and share it?
I'm not s'posin', I'm in love with you . . .""
He wriggles beneath her.  She takes his hand, presses it onto her
breast.
129. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)
INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE continues UNDERNEATH as RORSCHACH backs through
the kitchen with his bucket.  SMOKE billows in from the living room.
He empties TWO BOTTLES OF COOKING OIL on the linoleum floor.  Then he
ducks through a door into the BACK STAIRWELL.
130. INT. STAIRWELL LANDING - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)
RORSCHACH opens a bottle of CLEANING FLUID, stuffs a wad of newspaper
into its neck.  The first wave of COPS -- coughing and hacking from
the smoke -- makes it into the kitchen just as he IGNITES his molotov
cocktail and TOSSES IT INSIDE.
The COPS pitch backward as the bottle blows up.  By the time they hit
the floor, the COOKING OIL has burst into flame.
RORSCHACH bolts up the stairs; by now, another squad of CTU MEN is
coming up with back way behind him.
131. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)
Charred COPS, leaping FLAMES.  CAMERA ZEROES IN on the GAS STOVE.
132. EXT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)
A GAPING HOLE blows open in the front of the building.  FIERY RUBBLE
hails down on the CTU units outside.  Re-enter Fats on vocals:
""S'posin' I should hug you and caress you? . . .
Would it impress you? . . .""
133. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
LAURIE is fumbling with DREIBERG's pants.  Finally he can't stand it
anymore -- and with a pained, stricken look he pushes her away and
sits up on the sofa.  His head sinks into his hands.  At first she
doesn't understand; then her face softens, and she moves to his side,
embracing his shoulders, gently stroking his hair.
"". . . Or would it distress you?""
134. INT. TENEMENT - BACK STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS)
RORSCHACH huddled on the uppermost landing, just below roof level.
By now the whole building is ablaze.  Two flights down, a pair of CTU
COPS are fighting their way through the inferno, still on his tail.
He still has his mop bucket; it's half-full of water.  He reaches for
his last can -- a can of DRANO -- and empties it into the bucket,
where it begins to HISS and SIZZLE.
""S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .
Would you think I'm speaking out of turn . . .""
The COPS are almost on him, racing upward two steps at a time.  He
steps out in front of them, and -- before they can hoist their
weapons -- HEAVES THE BUCKETFUL OF BOILING DRANO into their faces.
The COPS SHRIEK SOUNDLESSLY and topple backwards into the flames as
RORSCHACH turns tail and bursts through the door to the roof.
135. EXT. TENEMENT ROOF - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
RORSCHACH emerges -- and a BLINDING LIGHT catches him full in the
face.  Hovering not twenty feet overhead is a POLICE AIRSHIP -- a
blimp-like craft of the sort we saw earlier.  A spray of MACHINE-GUN
FIRE peppers the roof.
""S'posin' I declare it.
Would you take my love and share it? . . .""
RORSCHACH scuttles along the edge of the roof, finds a rickety FIRE
ESCAPE, and dives over.  Unfortunately, he's now exposed on the front
of the building -- pinned to the wall by gunfire from the SWAT TEAM on
the street.  TONGUES OF FLAME dart from nearby windows.  He turns and
tries to climb back upward, but more COPS -- frm the just-landed
AIRSHIP -- are already spilling over the edge of the roof.
""I ain't s'posin', I'm in love with you.""
The song ends.  And on the last note, RORSCHACH emits an ungodly HOWL
OF FURY -- diving over the metal railing, PLUNGING to the street
below.
136. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT
Three stories down, he crashes into a cluster of garbage cans -- and
lies there, spent, twisted, wracked with pain.  The CTU COPS are on
him instantly, kicking him, pummeling him with billy clubs and rifle
butts.
COPS
GET HIM!  GET HIS MASK!  LET'S SEE THE LITTLE FUCKER'S FACE!!
RORSCHACH
GNAAAAHH!!  NO!! NO!!
In seconds the inkblot mask is off -- revealing a pocked, doughy face
topped off with a shock of MATTED RED HAIR.  It's a familiar
face . . . the face of the STREET CRAZY who haunts the newsstand
with his placards announcing the end of the world.
COP
Christ.  He's got five-inch heels.  The fuckin' runt wears
elevator shoes!
RORSCHACH
NO!!  NO!!  GIVE IT BACK!!
He kicks and claws at the COPS as they drag him unceremoniously off
to a nearby van.
COP II
So that's the terror of the underworld.  That ugly little zero.
RORSCHACH
GIVE ME BACK MY FACE!!!
The van doors slam shut on RORSCHACH -- just as the first FIRE TRUCKS
arrive to turn their hoses on the flaming skeleton of the tenement.
CUT TO:
137. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE stretched out on the sofa, under a blanket.  He
stares up at the ceiling, still troubled.
DREIBERG
I'm sorry, Laurie.  I --
LAURIE
It's all right, Dan.  I just want you to hold me, okay?  -- Just hold
me.
For a few moments she lies nestled peacefully against his chest.  His
gaze drifts over to the TV.  Suddenly he BLANCHES.
LAURIE
Daniel.  What --
On the TV screen is a huge bluescreen closeup of RORSCHACH.  DANIEL
reaches for the remote control to turn up the volume.
TV ANCHOR
. . . A ten-year manhunt ended tonight with the capture of the masked
vigilante known as Rorschach.  Eight CTU men died in the violent
confrontation at a downtown tenement . . .
The news report CUTS LIVE to the smoking wreckage of the tenement.
LAURIE
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
DREIBERG
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get
to trial.
Now the screen shows side-by-side closeups of the inkblot mask and
the acne-scarred face beneath it.  LAURIE looks on, transfixed.
TV ANCHOR
. . . identified as Walter Joseph Kovacs, 44, a transient with a
history of psychological disorders.  A former landlord described
Kovacs as a self-confessed loner and political extremist:
LANDLORD (ON TV)
All kinda weirdo literature, paraphernalia . . . you shoulda seen that
place when I threw him out.  Talk about pigpens --
LAURIE hits the mute button, settles back and lets out a low
whistle.  DREIBERG, distracted, pours a glass of wine and gets up to
pace the room.
LAURIE
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.
(beat)
I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel?
What's wrong?
DREIBERG
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
He stares at her, obviously wondering: who's next?
138. EXT. NEWS KIOSK - EVENING
The familiar NEWS VENDOR peddling papers.  A feisty little BLACK KID
-- the same one who made a face at RORSCHACH -- sits on the pavement
nearby, reading a comic book.
The NEWS VENDOR nudges him, indicates the comic book: a patriotic
little number entitled ""COLONEL NORTH AND HIS HOWLING COMMANDOS.""
NEWS VENDOR
Hey, this ain't a lending library.  I expect you to pay me for
that.
KID
No way.  This one sucks.
A CUSTOMER -- 50, black, on the tubby side -- stops at the
newsstand.  His name is DR. MALCOLM LONG.
DR. LONG
Gazette, please.
The NEWS VENDOR hands over a copy of the Gazette.  The cover
bears side-by-side photos of RORSCHACH and his alter ego, KOVACS,
with the banner headline: ""CTU APPREHENDS MASKED KILLER.""
NEWS VENDOR
'Dyou see this?  This guy's a customer of mine!
(shaking his head)
I mean, I always knew he was a little flaky, but -- wild, huh?  You
never know.
LONG hands over a quarter, unfolds the paper and begins to read as he
wanders off down the street.
139. STUDY - NIGHT
DR. LONG, who happens to be a police psychiatrist, sits at a big desk
with a vast heap of paperwork -- which includes a mug sheet of
RORSCHACH (minus the mask) and a neatly-typed arrest report from the
NYPD:
NAME: Kovacs, Walter Joseph
ADDRESS: Transient
BORN: 3/21/43
MOTHER'S NAME: Kovacs, Sylvia J. (nee Glick)
FATHER'S NAME: Unknown
By now LONG is working on his third pot of coffee.  His wife, SYLVIA,
wanders in behind him, dressed for bed in her robe and slippers.  When
she rests her hands on his shoulders, he nearly jumps out of his
seat.
DR. LONG
Oh!  Sorry.  I didn't hear you.
SYLVIA
How much longer?
(staring down at the desk)
It's that vigilante, isn't it.  That --
DR. LONG
Rorschach
(correcting himself)
Kovacs.  Incredible case.  Blinded two children at the age of ten.
We pulled his record from the juvenile home --
Without looking up he shoves a sheaf of papers in SYLVIA's
direction.
DR. LONG (cont.)
No father.  Mother a prostitute.  Some evidence of systematic child
abuse . . .
(swiveling to face her)
Classic case of misplaced aggression.  You know, these vigilantes,
these ""Watchmen"" -- there's never been a systematic study to find out
just what makes them do it.
SYLVIA
Malcolm, don't get too -- overwhelmed by all this.
SYLVIA picks up a blurry xerox of a child's drawing: TWO HIDEOUS
FIGURES, male and female, with wild eyes, fangs, and matted hair.
They're conjoined like Siamese twins at the mouth, belly, and
crotch.  This twisted vision of coitus bears the crayoned title ""MY
DREAM by W.J. Kovacs, Age 13.""
It's too strong to look at for long.  She sets it down with a
shiver.
SYLVIA (cont.)
Why don't you come to bed?
DR. LONG
(totally engrossed)
I'd like to get my hands on some of the others.  Explosive
material.
(grabbing a transcript)
Mother died when he was fourteen.  When they told him, he had one
word of comment: ""Good.""
SYLVIA shoots him a hard look, shakes her head almost imperceptibly,
and gives up.  She turns and pads silently out of the room.  LONG
goes right on talking, unaware that his audience has left.
DR. LONG (cont.)
Still, he's not stupid.  In some ways he's got an
extraordinary mind.  I think I can reach him.
(nodding his head)
I can reach him.
CUT TO:
140. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
A bare, windowless chamber, 10' by 10'.  LONG and RORSCHACH sit in
folding chairs on opposite sides of a square table.  The doctor
reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a stack of CARDS.
DR. LONG
Now, Walter, you obviously know what these are.  I want you to look
at each card in turn and tell me what it reminds you of.  All
right?
RORSCHACH's face is bruised, bloodied, and blank.  DR. LONG turns up
the first card, a symmetrical inkblot, part of a Rorschach test.
RORSCHACH
Butterfly.
LONG nods, makes a notation on a pad, turns up the next card.
RORSCHACH (cont.)
Some nice flowers.
LONG eyes him skeptically, makes another note, turns up the third
card.  RORSCHACH stares at it for a long moment.
RORSCHACH (cont.)
A doggy.  A big old floppy-eared dog.
He shows the hint of a smile.  DR. LONG heaves a sigh of
frustration.
DR. LONG
Walter --
RORSCHACH
Don't call me that.
DR. LONG
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to
hear.
RORSCHACH
Wrong answers?
DR. LONG
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest
response, I can't help you.
(pause)
I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
RORSCHACH
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
LONG knows the standard procedure for intransigent cases like this.
He shrugs indifferently, reaches for his briefcase, then gropes under
the table and presses a buzzer to summon the guards.
DR. LONG
Well, then.  Have it your way, Walter.  Let me know when you decide
to cooperate.
TWO PRISON GUARDS enter through a steel door.  RORSCHACH gets up to
leave.  He pauses in the doorway.
RORSCHACH
Doctor.  You don't want to help me.  You just want to find out what
makes me sick.
(beat)
You'll find out.  -- You'll find out.
CUT TO:
141. INT. VEIDT INDUSTRIES PYRAMID - DAY
A huge open atrium on the ground floor, with marble columns,
fountains, eucalyptus trees -- an Egyptian pleasure garden.
JUSTINE's hanging out with her video crew; they spot VEIDT on the
central escalator and swing into action.
JUSTINE
Adrian!  Adrian!  Can you give us a comment of Rorschach?
He's not at all happy to see her.  His FLUNKIES -- bodyguards and
secretaries -- form a wedge around him as he tries to push past the
cameras.
VEIDT
No comment.
JUSTINE
Did you know he was back on the streets?
VEIDT
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
JUSTINE
Isn't it true that you --
He keeps walking, with JUSTINE in hot pursuit.  Then, wide-eyed, he
STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.  An ARMED GUNMAN has stepped out from behind a
pillar -- directly into VEIDT's path.
ASSASSIN
VEIDT!
VEIDT DIVES.  The ASSASSIN'S BULLET catches JUSTINE in the gut and
comes out the other side in a spray of blood.  With a gymnast's
agility VEIDT rolls to the right -- and comes up with a BRASS ASHTRAY
in his hands.
He swings it into the ASSASSIN'S RIBS, knocking him backward into a
FOUNTAIN.  The GUN skitters off across the marble floor.
As the SECURITY STAFF races up, VEIDT steps INTO THE FOUNTAIN and
slams the dazed ASSASSIN'S HEAD into a decorative bust of King
Tut.
VEIDT
Son of a bitch.  Who sent you?
Arms flying, the two men grapple.  VEIDT grabs hold of a ASSASSIN's
hair and thrusts a HAND into his MOUTH.
SECURITY GUARD
Stand back, Mr. Veidt!  We'll handle it!
VEIDT
He's got some kind of poison capsule.  Don't bite down, you
scum, I want to know who sent you!
The ASSASSIN gags -- and GOES LIMP.  His lifeless body slumps down
into the water.  VEIDT steps out, shaken and breathless.
VEIDT
Goddammit . . .
SECURITY GUARD
Who'd wanna kill you, Mr. Veidt?
VEIDT
I don't know.  I don't know.  -- Get an ambulance for Miss James.

142. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - DUSK
TIGHT ON a portable TV tuned to the evening news.
NEWSCASTER
-- third day of rioting in major European capitals amid escalating
fears of nuclear war.  In London, six people were trampled outside
St. Paul's cathedral when overflow crowds were turned away from
morning Mass --
A PHONE RINGS.  DREIBERG, who's sprawled on his bed watching the TV,
reaches for the receiver.
DREIBERG
Yeah.
(beat)
Adrian!  What's up?
143. INTERCUT VEIDT AND DREIBERG
VEIDT
In have something to tell you.  I wanted to call before you heard it
on the news.
(beat)
Someone tried to kill me today.
For a moment DREIBERG says nothing.  He's not altogether
surprised.
DREIBERG
Who?
VEIDT
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm
starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
DREIBERG
She's with me.
VEIDT
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.
(beat)
Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until
all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
DREIBERG
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
He hangs up and weighs his options while he stares at the box.
LAURIE enters from the hallway, dressed in a bathrobe, toweling off
her hair.
LAURIE
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
DREIBERG
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.
(beat)
. . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
He doesn't say any more than that.  He doesn't have to.  LAURIE picks
up on the implications immediately.  She exhales sharply, turns away
from him and steadies herself against a bureau.
DREIBERG
-- What is it.
LAURIE
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't
around.
DREIBERG
Laurie --
LAURIE
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
DREIBERG
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
His sour wisecrack starts her trembling -- almost crying.  DREIBERG,
fed up with his own pessimism, climbs out of bed and walks over
behind her.
LAURIE
I shouldn't be here anyway, Daniel.  There's something I haven't told
you --
But before she does he shushes her, wraps his arms around her from
behind.
DREIBERG
Laurie, I'm not afraid.  I want you with me.  I want it more than
anything else in the world.
CUT TO:
144. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT
CONVICTS lined up with metal trays at a long cafeteria-style serving
area.  RORSCHACH enters in prison greys.  As he makes his way toward
the dinner line, we PICK UP a chorus of comments from the nearby
tables:
VOICE
Hey Rorschach.  You dead, man.  Just a matter of time now --
VOICE II
Rorschach.  Better put some meat on that pretty ass of yours --
Low, threatening CHUCKLES all around as an expressionless RORSCHACH
picks up his tray.  A TRIO OF GOONS falls in behind him.  The
smallest of them outweighs him by a good forty pounds.
GOON I
Didn't know he was such a tiny little thing.
GOON II
Little?  Naw, he's a big man.  Big man.
RORSCHACH'S FACE shows no emotion.  He moves forward in the line.  A
SERVER drops a gristly chunk of meat on his tin plate.
GOON III
I'd like to get his autograph.  I got my autograph book right here. .
.
GOON III reaches into his pocket and withdraws an ICEPICK.
GOON III (cont.)
Notched up some big names over the years.
Suddenly RORSCHACH spins, catching GOON III's head with the edge of
his dinner tray.  The icepick clatters to the floor.  GOON III
follows.
The others are on him in an instant, PINNING HIM against the serving
counter.  Instead of resisting, RORSCHACH vaults backward.  He brings
a KNEE up into GOON II's chine, grabs a fistful of GOON I's hair, and
tumbles back OVER THE COUNTER -- dragging GOON I's head, face down,
into a steam tray full of bubbling SOUP.
Landing on his feet, keeping his grip on GOON I's hair, RORSCHACH
uses his free hand to bury a FORK in a CAFETERIA WORKER's gut.  GOON
II lunges at him across the counter.  He grabs a VAT off a nearby
burner and, with a single sweep of the arm, DOUSES both GOONS -- with
HOT COOKING FAT.
All this has taken five seconds maximum.  WHISTLES shriek as the two
disfigured GOONS writhe on the floor in hideous agony, faces cracked
and smoking.  CAFETERIA WORKERS clear a path as PRISON GUARDS rush in
with billy clubs drawn.
As the GUARDS haul him off, RORSCHACH emits a ferocious HISS.  It
sounds uncannily like the sizzle of boiling oil on human flesh.
CUT TO:
145. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY WING - NIGHT
A prison TRUSTY wheels a cart down a long, empty corridor --
delivering dinner to the prisoners in solitary confinement.  Some of
the cells are visible, through ordinary barred entries; others are
totally sealed off, with sliding service trays mounted in solid metal
doors.
At a cell of the latter kind, the TRUSTY knocks once on the door,
then throws back a small panel to reveal the impassive face of
RORSCHACH.
TRUSTY
Hey Rorschach.  Those cats you threw the grease on -- they're dyin'
man.
(beat)
Their friends are talkin' 'bout it.  Say if those two go under . . .
this whole place blows.
RORSCHACH emits his trademark HISS and turns from the door.  The
TRUSTY chuckles in anticipation.
TRUSTY (cont.)
I'd hate to be you, man.  Locked in here with the likes of --

I'm not locked in here with them.  They're locked in here with me.
With that, the panel slides suddenly SHUT in the TRUSTY's face.

146. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
LONG and RORSCHACH have changed rooms.  The new room -- two chairs, a
square table -- is identical to the first, except for the REINFORCED
WIRE MESH which spans its width, separating doctor from patient.
Through a narrow opening in the wire, DR. LONG slides a card across
the table for RORSCHACH's inspection.  It's the same series of
inkblots as before, the ""butterfly"" leading off.  But this time, the
subject has decided to cooperate:
RORSCHACH
A whore fucking.
DR. LONG
Who is she?  Do you know her?
Too obvious; no response.  LONG moves on to card #2 -- the ""nice
flowers"":
RORSCHACH (cont.)
Man's guts.  Falling out of his shirt.
LONG clears his throat almost imperceptibly and nods.  Card #3:
RORSCHACH (cont.)
Doggy.  Big old floppy-eared dog --
(pause; then, smiling)
-- with his skull split open.
DR. LONG
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
RORSCHACH
Why, doctor.  I did.
(beat)
He was a bad dog.
RORSCHACH is toying with him now.  DR. LONG gets down to brass
tacks.
DR. LONG
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In
your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
RORSCHACH
God isn't there to do it.
DR. LONG
We don't know that.
RORSCHACH eyes him for a moment, then nods sagely: oh yes we do.
DR. LONG
So the rest of the world is wrong, and you're right.  Is that it?
(no response)
You tried to help people once.  What turned you around?  -- Why
would you want to kill a dog?
With LONG firmly on the hook, RORSCHACH settles back to elucidate:
RORSCHACH
One night I opened my eyes -- saw the world.
147. EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
Ruined buildings, broken windows.  The streets are silent except for
the distant sound of dogs BARKING.  RORSCHACH'S NARRATION continues
OVER SCENE:
RORSCHACH (V.O.)
'75.  Kidnap case, the little Franco girl.  Weeks dragged by -- no
word.  Thought of little child, alone, frightened . . . decided to
intervene.
The lone figure of RORSCHACH emerges from the shadows and turns up
his collar.  He strides deliberately down the sidewalk past a
ramshackle wooden storm fence covered with obscene graffiti.
RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)
Got a tip.  Abandoned dress factory in Brooklyn.
He peers through a broken slat in the fence.  In a side yard, TWO
HUGE GERMAN SHEPHERDS growl playfully, fighting over some unseen
object.
148. INT. DRESS FACTORY - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
A DOOR swings open and RORSCHACH enters.  He pockets a metal file,
flicks on a flashlight.
Mannequins, decrepit sewing machines, rolls of rotting fabric.  The
light shines on a small, dank cot in the corner.  RORSCHACH wanders
over.  He finds opened tins of food, an overturned water glass -- and
on the floor, a ROPE.
There's a pot-bellied stove nearby.  RORSCHACH crouches beside it,
sticks a hand inside, and sifts through the ashes; he pulls out a
charred scrap of FABRIC from a child's pajamas, decorated with
balloons and teddy bears.
He stands.  In the opposite corner of the room is a big wooden
CHOPPING BLOCK.  RORSCHACH wanders over and examines the surrounding
paraphernalia: a cleaver, a bone saw, an assortment of butcher's
knives.  He stands there a moment, then moves to a wire-mesh
WINDOW.
RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)
Dogs wouldn't shut up.  That's when I knew where the little girl had
gone.
149. HIS POV - THE YARD OUTSIDE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
The German shepherds romp in the dying light.  We CLOSE IN ON the
dogs until we see what it is they're tussling over: A BIG BLOODY KNOB
OF BONE.
RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)
Decided to wait for the owner . . .
150. INT. FACTORY - ENTRY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
Keys in the lock.  A moment later, the door swings wide;  a FAT MAN
enters and whistles to the dogs.
FAT MAN
Fred?  Barney?  Dinnerti--
RORSCHACH steps out of the shadows and BASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD.
151. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
RORSCHACH, master of suspense, decides to take a break in the
story.  He leans back in his chair.  Finally DR. LONG, dreading his
reply, asks:
DR. LONG
Then what happened?
RORSCHACH
. . . Made a little trip to the butcher store.  Locked up tight.  Had
to break in.
152. INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
The FAT MAN squirms on the floor, a gag in his mouth.  He's
handcuffed to an exposed pipe.  RORSCHACH strides into frame with a
GROCERY SACK.
He kneels beside the FAT MAN and loosens his gag.  Then he peels off
his glove and reaches into the sack.
FAT MAN
What -- what are you d--
RORSCHACH silences the FAT MAN by cramming a fistful of RAW HAMBURGER
into his open mouth.  He's got several pounds of the stuff, and he
spends the next few seconds SMEARING IT all over the FAT MAN's face,
throat, and hands, stuffing the leftovers down his shirt.  When he's
done, he reaches into the sack for a big plastic bag full of STEER
BLOOD . . . and EMPTIES IT over the FAT MAN's head.
FRANTIC SCRATCHING from outside.  RORSCHACH strolls over to the door,
and -- as the FAT MAN wriggles in helpless terror -- lets the dogs
inside.
Then he stands back and enjoys the carnage.
153. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
DR. LONG looks on goggle-eyed as RORSCHACH cheerfully wraps things
up.
RORSCHACH
When they finished eating, picked up a cleaver . . .  split their
skulls.  Died happy.  Full bellies.
(leaning forward)
See, God didn't kill the little girl.  Or the man that killed
her . . . or the dogs, or me.  If God saw what any of us did,
he did't seem to mind.
DR. LONG
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
RORSCHACH
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make
it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.
(slight smile)
What else can I illuminate?
LONG's had enough.  He reaches for the concealed buzzer and the
PRISON GUARDS file in.  RORSCHACH gets up; before he turns to go, he
points a finger at LONG's inkblot.
RORSCHACH (cont.)
No right and wrong, Doc.  You said so.  Maybe not a dog.  Maybe . . .
just a man's face.
(pause)
See it now?
The GUARDS drag RORSCHACH out.  DR. LONG, still queasy, empties a
couple of pills from a bottle and gulps them down dry.  After a
second he reaches for his briefcase; as he's gathering his cards, he
STOPS suddenly -- his gaze riveted to the random, symmetrical pattern
on top of the stack.  Its seems to SHIFT before his eyes.
LONG blinks, swallows hard.  We MOVE IN tighter and tighter on the
Rorschach blot, INKY BLACKNESS filling the screen as we.
DISSOLVE TO:
154. EXT. BARN - TOWARD DUSK
A rural tree-lined area outside the city.  A COMPACT BUBBLE-CAR pulls
up outside a big ramshackle barn and stops; DREIBERG gets out, goes to
the padlocked doors, fumbles in his pocket for a key.
After a moment, LAURIE wanders up beside him.
LAURIE
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
DREIBERG
Memory lane.
He opens the padlock, ushers LAURIE inside.
155. INT. BARN - A MOMENT LATER
Inside the barn is a HUGE OBLONG SHAPE covered with a TARPAULIN.
LAURIE
Daniel . . .
DREIBERG
Gimme a hand with the tarp, would you?  You take that side.
She goes around and bends to unfasten the tarp.  The two of them pull
it back to reveal . . .
THE OWLSHIP -- NIGHT OWL's high-tech HOVERCRAFT.  It's a bit
tarnished from years of disuse, but it's still an impressive sight.
DREIBERG stands back to admire it; an impressed LAURIE wanders around
to join him, wearing an ear-to-ear grin.
LAURIE
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
DREIBERG
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
156. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The two of them enter.  DREIBERG sits at the controls and turns on
the electrical system while LAURIE wanders through the cabin,
reliving days gone by.
LAURIE
Wow, this brings back some memories.  Does it still fly?
DREIBERG
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some
cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
LAURIE
Antarctica??
DREIBERG
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come
along.
(pause)
I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a
bad place to sit out a war.
LAURIE
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be
left.
DREIBERG
You and me.
He looks directly at her.  Suddenly uncomfortable, she averts her
gaze, gets up, and begins rummaging around in the back of the
cabin.  DREIBERG turns back to the control panel, feeling subtly
rejected.
DREIBERG
. . . Yeah, you're right.  Probably wouldn't make it down there
anyway.
Behind him, LAURIE lets out a little SQUEAL of delight.  She's just
opened a compartment door; inside it are a handful of GAUDY COSTUMES
-- their old superhero togs.
LAURIE
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
DREIBERG
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.
(chuckling)
The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping
people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't
know.  It all seems so abstract.
LAURIE's holding her old costume up against her shoulders, eyeing
herself in a small mirror above a sink.
LAURIE
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
DREIBERG
What are you up to?
LAURIE
Don't look.  Turn around.
Smirking, he complies.  LAURIE begins to undress in the back of the
cabin.
DREIBERG
This'd better not be what I think it is.
LAURIE
Okay!
DREIBERG turns around.  LAURIE's in full costume, looking quite
imposing and, in a perverse way, quite beautiful.  He feigns
shock:
DREIBERG (cont.)
My God, it's the Silk Spectre -- scourge of the underworld, defender
of the weak!
LAURIE
In the flesh.
She ambles over to the control panel, embraces DREIBERG from behind,
and strokes his thinning hair.
LAURIE (cont.)
Poor Daniel.  You really miss it all, don't you.
DREIBERG
Saving the world?  I guess I do.
(smiling)
Maybe we can still save ourselves . . .
DISSOLVE TO:
157. EXT. SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - DUSK
A massive PEACE RALLY downtown.  Thousands of citizens have turned
out; PLACARDS and PROTEST SIGNS are everywhere.  Each remark is met
by CHEERS and CHANTS, by raucous
BOOS as well . . . and while the crowd is split between pacifists and
hawks, they're all frightened as hell.
Things are much the same in London, Berlin -- possibly even Moscow.
The end is nigh, and passions flare.  It's anarchy waiting to
happen.
MAN ON STAGE
You know what the Joint Chiefs of Staff are doing right now?  They're
sitting in the Pentagon talking about a first strike.  That's right --
a first strike!
VOICE IN CROWD
You think the reds ain't doing the same thing?
MAN ON STAGE
Then for the love of God let's negotiate.  We can start a war.  But
we can't stop it!!
VOICE IN CROWD II
It's pinko simps like you that drove Dr. Manhattan to Mars!
VOICE IN CROWD III
Dr. Manhattan was an inhuman fascist!
VOICE IN CROWD IV
It's God's judgment!  Jesus is the way!
A HECKLER fights his way onstage and lunges for the microphone:
HECKLER
Russia's just been waiting for an opening.  They won't show us
no mercy.  I say NUKE 'EM NOW!!
MAN ON STAGE
You think this is some kind of grudge match??  We're talking the
end of the world!!
The two of them grapple at the mike, and the HECKLER falls off the
stage.  On cue, the crowd ERUPTS.  FIGHTS break out; COPS start
swinging rifle butts.
As PRO-NUKERS swarm the stage, our gaze turns upward.  A trio of
HOVERCRAFT hangs in the air above the seaport.  Their undersides --
outfitted with heavy artillery on turrets -- bear the initials
""CTU""
158. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
CTU MEN watch the nascent riot through a plexiglass canopy.
CTU CAPTAIN
I've had it with these a-holes.  Drop the gas.
159. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
PANIC amongs the crowds as TEAR GAS CANISTERS explode in their
midst.  The CTU ships descend ever closer to the ground.
LOUDSPEAKER
CEASE AND DESIST AT ONCE.  WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO USE FORCE.
A couple of COPS go down in the melee.  RIOTERS grab their rifles,
turn them on the CTU ships overhead.  OTHERS in the crowd fling
rocks, brickbats -- whatever's handy.  HYSTERIA RULES.
CUT TO:
160. INT. BARN - DUSK
DREIBERG walks around to the front of the Owlship with a TOOLKIT,
wiping his hands on an oily rag.  He calls inside to LAURIE:
DREIBERG
Guess that ought to do it.  Let's shut her down --  Laurie?
No reply.  Curious, he climbs aboard.
161. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
LAURIE's standing by the monitor over the instrument console.  Her
face is distraught, agonized.
LAURIE
Daniel, you ought to take a look at this.
Onscreen, it's total screaming chaos.  CANNONS on the bellies of the
CTU HOVERCRAFT swivel randomly, spitting AUTOMATIC FIRE at the mobs
below.
DREIBERG
What the hell -- ?
LAURIE
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
DREIBERG
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
He turns away, paralyzed with horror.  LAURIE watches awestruck.
LAURIE
They're just mowing 'em down.
(pause)
This is it.  The end of the world.  This is what it looks like.
CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on DREIBERG's stricken face as we
CUT TO:
162. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE>
We're back in slo-mo sepia land, the Golden Age of Superheroes.  THE
OWLSHIP emerges from a fogbank and rises majestically into frame,
like the Seventh Cavalry arriving to save the day.  As it draws
closer, the perspex canopy coming into view, we can just make out
NIGHT OWL at the helm, with SILK SPECTRE riding shotgun.
There's a FRENZIED MOB below, racing right and left, their aimless
motions stylized and surreal.  They're beset by a sudden WINDSTORM as
the Owlship's powerful BLOWERS clear the TEAR GAS from this fantasy
equivalent of the seaport plaza.  Faces turn skyward; fingers point --
-- and suddenly, the footage we're watching undergoes a SUBTLE
TRANSFORMATION.  COLORS bleed in; SOUND comes up; the pace of the
action QUICKENS.  And when we cut back to the ship overhead, we're in
full-color and real-time --
163. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP
-- because the Owlship is really there . . . and by God, the
Watchmen are back in action a quarter-mile above the South St.
Seaport!
164. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The three CTU SHIPS are now visible through the cockpit dome.
DREIBERG
Okay Laurie, let's see if we've still got what it takes.
On the panel, a COMPUTER TARGETING DEVICE homes in on a CTU SHIP.
165. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT
A RADAR MAN stares at his console in puzzlement.
CTU RADAR MAN
Sir, we've got an odd blip off starboard . . .
The ship ROCKS VIOLENTLY as a sudden EXPLOSION --
166. AERIAL SHOT - ON CTU HOVERCRAFT
-- BLOWS THE CANNON MOUNT CLEANLY OFF ITS UNDERSIDE!!  The ruptured
ship WOBBLES, trying to right itself, but to no avail; jets
sputtering, it lurches toward the harbor and SLAPS DOWN HARD against
the water.
167. ANGLE ON CROWD
pointing at the skies in disbelief.
VOICE IN CROWD
LOOK!  UP THERE!
VOICE IN CROWD II
Oh my God, it's --

168. INT. OWLSHIP - ON DREIBERG
He barks into a microphone:
DREIBERG
Attention CTU!  Cease fire immediately --
169. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
Ground level.  From the midst of the bewildered CROWD we watch as the
OWLSHIP and the CTU talk some serious trash:
OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER
-- or we'll BLOW YOUR ASSES OUT OF THE SKY!
CTU LOUDSPEAKER
UNREGISTERED CRAFT.  IDENTIFY YOURSELF.
OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER
BABY . . . WE'RE A BLAST FROM THE PAST.
The crowd's in a frenzy.  Most of them are taking it on the lam.  But
a dozen hardy souls are standing stock-still, transfixed by the
strange sight overhead.
VOICE IN CROWD
. . . IT'S THE WATCHMEN!!
EXCITEMENT RIPPLES through the CROWD as the CTU SHIPS bob in the air,
clumsily turning to face their attacker.  Soon the ships are hanging
immobile in midair, squaring off face-to-face, a Wild West
showdown.  On the prows of all three craft, MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate
into position.
170. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG with his hand poised on the throttle.
DREIBERG
We're gonna have to shave this one close.
An instant before the CTU rockets FIRE, DREIBERG shoves the throttle
FULL-FORWARD.
171. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP
With a burst of flame, the Owlship BLASTS OFF.  The TWO ROCKETS
CONVERGE on the point where the OWLSHIP was hovering a millisecond
before -- and COLLIDE.  BOOM.  The OWLSHIP, meanwhile, HURTLES
FORWARD -- slicing DIRECTLY BETWEEN the two CTU SHIPS.  The CROWD
CHEERS.
172. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
DREIBERG rides the JOYSTICK.  LAURIE watches a monitor showing the
aft view from the ship.
LAURIE
They're following us.
DREIBERG
All right.  Mission accomplished.
He's no sooner said it than MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the rear of the
ship.  He arcs hard left and DROPS, taking evasive action.
173. EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP streaks between the twin towers.  A second later, the CTU
SHIPS rip past on either side.
174. EXT. STREET - NIGHT
ASTONISHED PEDESTRIANS GAPE at the bizarre DOGFIGHT above them.  The
OWLSHIP doglegs around a darkened office building.  A CTU MISSILE
blows a HOLE in its facade.
175. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP
firing TWO MISSILES aftward at the pursuing craft.
176. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG exhilarated.  LAURIE, worried, checking the radar
readout:
LAURIE
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
DREIBERG
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
LAURIE
(checking the monitor)
They're practically on us . . .
DREIBERG
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
He punches a button on the dash.  It's labelled ""TURBO.""
177. AERIAL SHOT - ON AIRSHIP
The turbojets kick in and the Owlship ACCELERATES to 400 mph, leaving
the CTU craft in the dust.
178. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT
A line of TRAFFIC enters the tunnel.  The Owlship SWOOPS suddenly,
and -- just clearing the arch -- ENTERS ABOVE THEM.
A moment later, the LEAD CTU SHIP tries to follow.  Bad move.  The
less-maneuverable craft rams into the LIP of the arch -- and
EXPLODES
The SECOND CTU SHIP hurtles toward a similar fate.  But at the last
moment -- retro-jets blasting at full force -- it manages to STOP
ITSELF.  It backs up slightly, edges up OVER the tunnel, and settles
for the airborne route.
179. INT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - A MOMENT LATER
The OWLSHIP zooms through the tunnel, mere feet above the tops of the
cars.  HORNS HONK.  BRAKES SCREECH.
There's an oversized TRUCK directly in its path.  The OWLSHIP nudges
UP slightly -- and clears the truck by INCHES, throwing off SPARKS
against the roof of the tunnel.
180. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The end of the tunnel is coming up fast.
DREIBERG
Fog blowers on.  Activate radar shields.
181. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - OPPOSITE END - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP emerges from the tunnel and noses UPWARD at an
almost-vertical angle, spewing DENSE CLOUDS OF BILLOWING FOG in its
wake.  A few seconds later, the lone remaining CTU ship arrives --
but, seeing only FOG and no trace of the OWLSHIP, it pushes forward
on a horizontal course and disappears into the darkness beyond the
water.
182. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
They're in the middle of a cloudbank.  DREIBERG is wearing a look of
intense satisfaction as LAURIE nervously checks the radar.
LAURIE
We lost him.
He flashes her a smug little smile.  LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, she
shakes her head and buries her faces in her hands.
LAURIE (cont.)
Oh, Daniel . . . we are in deep shit now.
FADE THROUGH TO:
183. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT
The usual assortment of jailbirds lined up with trays in the serving
line.  A PRISON TRUSTY, in hospital-orderly whites, enters the hall
and falls in at the end of the line.  He nudges the CON in front of
him.
TRUSTY
Just left the infirmary.  Lost Otis about twenty minutes ago.
The CON nods, and whispers to the man in front of him.  The news goes
through the serving line like wildfire.  Within a matter of seconds,
it's reached the jailbird at the front of the line -- a hulk named
T-BONE.
CON IN LINE
Otis went down.
T-BONE nods and carries his tray to a nearby table, where a cadre of
SIX ENORMOUS THUGS are munching away.  Presiding over them is the
biggest man in the pen -- who happens, ironically, to be a MIDGET:
LITTLE BIGGER.
T-BONE
Just heard, boss.  Otis bought it.
LITTLE BIGGER
Fuckin' Rorschach.
(nodding to himself)
This joint goes up.  Tonight.
184. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT
Drifting lazily through a cloudbank.  The blunt prow of the owlship
emerges gradually from a shroud of fog and catches a shaft of pale
blue moonlight.
185. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
Through the cockpit window the distant city skyline glimmers, then
disappears again behind wisps of cloud.  We're taking a dreamy tour
of the stratosphere, slow and elegant.  Somewhere, Billie Holiday is
singing ""You're My Thrill.""
Instruments blink and peep on the panel.  No one's at the
controls.
The ship lurches.  A wine bottle tips and rolls noisily across the
width of the cabin floor.  A woman's hand reaches for it, sets it
right.
It's LAURIE, who's midway through a two-minute kiss with DREIBERG.
The pair of them are locking in a tight, post-coital embrace on the
cabin floor, their clothing in heaps around them.
LAURIE
Better.  Much better.
DREIBERG starts to say something, settles back with a serene smile
instead.
LAURIE (cont.)
I bet I know what made the difference this time.
DREIBERG
What?
LAURIE
(smirking)
The costumes.  Am I right?
DREIBERG seems mildly shocked by the proposition.  Then, despite
himself, he starts to chortle.  She pokes him playfully on the arm.
LAURIE (cont.)
Come on.  Admit it!
DREIBERG
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
LAURIE
Yes you are.
DREIBERG
(drily)
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.
(pause; then, seriously)
Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
LAURIE
That's because --
DREIBERG
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's
about to end.
(a weird smile)
I feel like I could save it.
He grabs his cloak, wraps it around him, and moves purposefully to
the instrument panel.  He throws a few switches, arcs the Owlship
hard right.
LAURIE
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
DREIBERG
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .
(turning to face her)
I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
LAURIE
. . . What??
DREIBERG -- rejuvenated, exhilarated, smiling ear-to-ear -- reaches
for the throttle and kicks the ship in to overdrive.
186. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT
AFTERBURNERS belch flame as the Owlship accelerates, ripping through
the clouds above the city.
CUT TO:
187. SERIES OF SHOTS - THE PRISON
-- and as Sly Stone once said, there's a riot goin' on.  SIRENS HOWL
as we get several quick glimpses of gleeful CONVICTS running wild:
disabling guards, overrunning cell blocks, liberating weapons,
throwing food.
188. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG and LAURIE, back in full costume.  DREIBERG's eyes are
riveted to a monitor over the controls:
DREIBERG
I think we're just a trifle late.
LAURIE
Jesus, Dan.  Out of the frying pan . . .
The MONITOR shows a magnified view of the PRISON COMPLEX below
them.  The prisoners have taken the quad, and are exchanging fire
with the guards in the watchtower.  It's an ugly, bloody mess.
DREIBERG
I know he's totally bugfuck, but he saved my life a half a dozen
times.
189. INT. CELL - NIGHT
SIRENS BLARING everywhere.  RORSCHACH sits on his bunk, his legs
drawn up before him, his eyes darting swiftly around the cell.
190. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY BLOCK - NIGHT
Smoke and confusion; ESCAPED CONVICTS racing to and fro past
sprawled, unconscious GUARDS.  In the midst of all the chaos, FOUR
MENACING FIGURES stride purposefully through the cellblock.  It's the
psychotic midget LITTLE BIGGER, with his three henchmen CARLOS, RAFE,
and T-BONE.
Wheeling an oversized ELECTRICAL ARC WELDER before them, they stop
outside RORSCHACH's cell and GRIN in anticipation.
LITTLE BIGGER
Find an outlet for this thing
(shouting)
Rorschach?  I did fifteen years because of you.  It's payback time!
RAFE finds an outlet and plugs in the arc welder.  CARLOS is carrying
a big nasty MEAT CLEAVER; he slides back the panel in RORSCHACH's
door, rattles the cleaver noisily in the frame.
CARLOS
See this, runt?  We're gonna take your puny little balls off . . .
and pickle 'em!!
(chortling)
Aww!  I think he just wet his pants!
HILARITY all around.  T-BONE shoves CARLOS aside and takes his place
at the panel in the door:
T-BONE
Lemme see.  Lemme see!
LITTLE BIGGER
Relax, boys.  Everybody gets a slice of turkey -- but I get to carve.
(to T-BONE)
What's he doin' now?
No response from T-BONE, who stands there with his face pressed
tightly to the panel.
LITTLE BIGGER (cont.)
You deaf?  I said, what's he --
He gives T-BONE a nudge.  T-BONE's legs buckle and he topples over
backwards, landing flat as a board on the floor.  A SOUP SPOON
quivers ion the air, its sharpened handle buried deep in his eye
socket.
RAFE
BOSS!  JESUS!
LITTLE BIGGER
Son of a bitch! -- WE'RE COMING RORSCHACH.  WE'RE GONNA PEEL YOU LIKE
A GRAPE.
(to RAFE)
Light the torch.
RAFE ignites the arc welder and the boys go to work on the lock of
RORSCHACH's cage.
191. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT
RORSCHACH waiting patiently on his bunk.  The metal lock on the
inside of the cell door is beginning to glow a dull red.
CUT TO:
192. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG hands LAURIE what looks like a pair of electronic
EARMUFFS.
DREIBERG
Okay, I'm turning on the screamers.  We'll have to hit the roof
running . . .
He throws a switch on the control panel.
193. EXT. PRISON COMPLEX - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
WINDOWS SHATTER in the guard towers as a WAILING ULTRASONIC SCREECH
splits the air.  On the roof of the complex, PARALYZED GUARDS drop
their weapons; ESCAPED PRISONERS clutch at their burst eardrums as
the Owlship descends and gently touches down. . .
194. INT. RORSCHACH'S CELL - THAT MOMENT
The LOCK is bright red and smoking.  Over on the bunk, RORSCHACH'S
FACE is lined with exertion.  His back is wedged tight against the
wall of the cell, his legs straining against the lip of his
TOILET.
Grunting and groaning, he manages to knock the TOILET off its
mounting.  The PIPES SPEW.  Within seconds, the FLOOR of the cell is
FLOODED.
195. INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE DOOR - A MOMENT LATER
RAFE kills the arc welder and stands back.
RAFE
Okay, boss, that oughta do it.
They give the door a shove.  It swings inward, and GALLONS OF WATER
come gushing out.  LITTLE BIGGER steps back in disgust.
LITTLE BIGGER
WHAT THE --
RAFE and CARLOS gape into the cell.  They see the broken toilet, but
there's no trace of RORSCHACH.
CARLOS
Rorschach.  Company's calling . . .
RAFE
Where is the fuckin' runt?
CARLOS advances cautiously toward the cell, the CLEAVER in his
fist.
196. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT
In answer to RAFE's question, RORSCHACH is hiding behind the door.
He SLAMS IT SHUT on CARLO's outstretched hand; the red-hot metal of
the LOCK catches CARLO'S WRIST; he shrieks and drops the cleaver. . .
. . . giving RORSCHACH just enough time to SNATCH IT UP.  He JUMPS,
monkey-like, and STANDS POISED ON HIS BUNK as the door swings wide
and an enraged CARLOS charges in, clutching his scorched forearm.
CARLOS
YOU'RE MINE NOW, YOU LITTLE --
From the bunk, RORSCHACH FLINGS the cleaver.  It strikes the floor
BETWEEN RAFE and CARLOS --
-- NEATLY SEVERING THE POWER CORD of the ARC WELDER --
-- which is SITTING in an INCH OF STANDING WATER.  RAFE and CARLOS do
a herky-jerky DANCE as 20,000 VOLTS course through their bodies --
-- and PITCH face-down into the water.  All lights in the cellblock
DIM and DIE.
LITTLE BIGGER backs off in gibbering horror as RORSCHACH climbs down
off his bunk, emerges from the cell and calmly steps over the bodies
of the dead.
RORSCHACH
Your move . . . runt.
The midget kingpin lets out a SCREAM and tears off down the corridor
as fast as his stubby little legs will carry him.
197. INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER
DREIBERG and LAURIE move down a dark, abandoned corridor, trying to
get their bearings.
LAURIE
Where are we?  What happened to the lights?
DREIBERG
Generators'll kick on in a minute.  We should be close to solitary .
. .
Their heads turn toward the end of the passage, where a SECOND
CORRIDOR crosses the one they're standing in.  As they watch, a
SCREAMING MIDGET sprints past -- and disappears.
DREIBERG and LAURIE blink in disbelief: huh?  A moment later, a
familiar figure with BRIGHT RED HAIR strides past.
DREIBERG
. . . Rorschach??
RORSCHACH pauses.  He stares at his costumed colleagues for a second
and a half -- then keeps on walking.
198. INT. PRISON - CROSS CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER
The terrified LITTLE BIGGER realizes he's just hit a dead end.  He
throws a glance over his shoulder, sees RORSCHACH moving up on him.
Desperate, he ducks into a MEN'S ROOM.
RORSCHACH follows, his pace measured and deliberate.  Behind him,
LAURIE and DREIBERG have just rounded the corner into the cross
corridor.
LAURIE
Rorschach!  Is that you??
He turns and holds up a finger: one moment, please.  Then, calm and
dispassionate, he enters the MEN's room.  DREIBERG and LAURIE stand
at the end of the corridor, mildly boggled.
LAURIE
What's he doing?
DREIBERG
I think he's going to the john.
LAURIE
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and
he stops to take a --
Before she can finish, RORSCHACH reemerges, wiping his hands on a
paper towel.  He wanders up to join them without so much as a
""howdy.""
DREIBERG
. . . That was quick.
RORSCHACH
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.
(beat)
Let's get out of here.
CUT TO:
199. EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT
A well-concealed RUNWAY somewhere in the heart of the Rocky
Mountains.  LIGHTS sweep the sky as GROUND CREWS run to and fro.
Air Force One is coming in for a landing.
200. INT. UNDERGROUND COMMAND BUNKER - A MOMENT LATER
Lots of activity: armed troops, top brass, and technicians milling
about.  Flashing panels on the walls read DEFCON 2.
SECRETARY OF STATE LIDDY watches as a METAL DOOR clangs shut, and
what looks like a GOLF CART comes toodling around a long metal
ramp.  PRESIDENT NIXON's in the passenger seat, and there's an
imposing pile of LUGGAGE in the back.  He appears to be contemplating
a long stay.
PRESIDENT NIXON
Hello, Gordon.  Have you seen Pat?
SECRETARY LIDDY
She's all settled in.  They want you down in the command room right
away.
LIDDY hops aboard, and the golf cart turns down a seemingly endless
corridor which leads deep into the bowels of the Rockies.
SECRETARY LIDDY (cont.)
Weatherman says we're lookin' good.  We've got a fourteen-hour
window.
PRESIDENT NIXON
Fourteen hours, huh?
SECRETARY LIDDY
Fourteen hours.  Unless of course the reds decide to hit us first.
CUT TO:
201. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT
LAURIE's following the Watchmen press coverage on an overhead screen
. . .
NEWSCASTER
-- in a daring midnight jailbreak.  Earlier eyewitness reports place
the one-time superheroes at a peace rally in --
. . . while DREIBERG and RORSCHACH sit side-by-side at the control
console, occupied by other matters.
DREIBERG
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
RORSCHACH
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his
mangy cat on me.
DREIBERG
What new information?
RORSCHACH
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan
somehow involved . . .
(scratching his chin)
Strange that no one's tried to attack you, Daniel.
There's an unmistakable tone of suspicion in his voice.  DREIBERG,
highly offended, shoots him a look of supreme resentment.
DREIBERG
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
LAURIE
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Still grumbling at each other, DREIBERG and RORSCHACH glance up at
the monitor LAURIE's watching.  The face of ADRIAN VEIDT fills the
screen:
NEWSCASTER
. . . The man behind the Watchmen, high-tech wizard Adrian Veidt, was
unavailable for comment.  A spokesman claimed he had left for the
Antarctic to study a mysterious hole in the ozone layer.
RORSCHACH
""Ozone layer""?
DREIBERG
(rolling his eyes)
Christ.  Couldn't he just admit that he's scared??
CUT TO:
202. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT
The last rays of sunlight bleed toward endless frozen plains of
pristine white.  A private AIRCRAFT descends toward an incongrous
strip of black, part of a massive complex of buildings centered
around what looks like a NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  (In fact, it is
one.)  This is Karnak -- VEIDT's Antarctic retreat.
203. INT. KARNAK - NIGHT
The entry hall is vast and lavish, appointed in the same Egyptian
style as his urban pyramid -- but on a grander scale.  A fur-clad
figure enters in a flurry of SNOW, followed by a genetically-altered
LYNX on the end of a leash; FOUR ASIAN LACKEYS appear to greet him.
One of them takes his parka; a second serves him hot coffee from a
silver tray; a third takes the leash, and brushes snow from the back
of the lynx.  Number four is in charge of protocol.
LACKEY
Welcome, sir.  We did not expect you so soon.
VEIDT
Feed Bubastis.  I'll have dinner when I've looked in on the world.
They hear and obey.  Two of them fall in behind VEIDT and follow him
to:
204. INT. INFORMATION CENTER - NIGHT
The room is empty but for a single chair, with a complicated
REMOTE-CONTROL KEYPAD mounted on the armrest.  Across from the chair,
RED VELVET CURTAINS hang from ceiling to floor.
VEIDT takes a seat, and his LACKEYS draw back the curtains to reveal
a towering WALL OF TELEVISIONS -- 200 monitors in a 10x20 grid,
picking up transmissions from all over the world.  It's far more
informational than the human mind could possibly digest at one gulp,
a hectic jumble of color and motion.  VEIDT loves it.  He settles in
and his eyes begin to rove.
205. ANGLE ON VIDEO WALL
PANNING across transmissions of every variety -- commercials,
sitcoms, sportscasts -- we settle on a screen labelled ""LONDON.""
VEIDT hits the volume button on his remote, and a NEWSCASTER'S VOICE
comes up.  On the wall behind her is a civil defense
logo . . .
BBC NEWSCASTER
-- best situated in a cellar room, as far away from windows as
possible.  Cinderblock walls are preferred, but a makeshift shelter
can be constructed of sandbags, or of boxes filled with --
FLICK, and the sound dies.  VEIDT's gaze drifts several screens to
the right, to the monitor labelled ""WASHINGTON D.C.""  Sound up:
NEWSCASTER
-- amid rumors that top-ranking officials and military personnel have
already been relocated to underground bunkers.  White House spokesmen
insist that no such precautions have yet been taken and that ongoing
negotiations --
FLICK: sound down.  Now we shift to a closed-circuit monitor at the
bottom right of the bank -- an exterior view of VEIDT's antarctic
retreat as seen by a surveillance camera.  FLICK: same subject, new
angle.  FLICK: a RADAR SCREEN, which shows no activity; the skies are
clear.  FLICK --
-- and now things get downright weird.  Because all at once we're
watching DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN, the earnest you scientist from
twenty-some years ago; he's sitting at a table in the Gila Flas
canteen, across from JANEY SLATER, and he's getting ready to
propose.
206. REVERSE ANGLE - ON VEIDT
eyeing young Osterman with a strange, grave smile.
CUT TO:
207. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT
LOW ANGLE on the Owlship as it descends slowly through the clouds.
On its underbelly, a VIDEO CAMERA grinds and rotates.
208. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE watch a monitor which shows an overhead view of
the city.  He punches up a series of PROGRESSIVE MAGNIFICATIONS,
gradually zeroing in on a single city block.  It's been cordoned off,
POLICE BUBBLE-CARS are parked up and down its length.
DREIBERG
They've got my building surrounded.
(looking up at her)
They must've been following you all along.
She stares at him.  The ship LURCHES as DREIBERG kicks in the
accelerator jets and takes off into the clouds.
DREIBERG (cont.)
So much for Dan Dreiberg, ordinary citizen.
LAURIE
Welcome back, Night Owl.
DREIBERG
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
RORSCHACH
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
DREIBERG
What do you mean, frame-up?
RORSCHACH
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
DREIBERG
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to
get back at us?
(spreading his hands)
What about all those poor shits with cancer?
TIGHT ON LAURIE, who's listening to all this with mounting
distress.
RORSCHACH
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive
propaganda scheme . . .
DREIBERG
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
LAURIE
(interrupting him)
It's not.
RORSCHACH
Not what?
LAURIE
Not ""propaganda.""
(pause; then, blurting it out --)
Christ, I'm one of them!  I've got it.
DREIBERG swivels abruptly in his chair and gapes at LAURIE, his face
bone-white.  She stares at the floor, afraid to meet his eyes, her
grim secret revealed.  For an awkward moment neither of them can
think of anything to say.
Then RORSCHACH, his mind already back on the ""case,"" breaks the
silence.
RORSCHACH
Hnrrr -- changes everything.  Let's get moving.
209. EXT. WATERFRONT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
RORSCHACH is crouched beside an exterior wall of the warehouse; he
pries off a couple of loose slats and digs around, swatting angrily
at a RAT which scampers out of the hole.  The OWLSHIP hovers
above.
210. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG, disconsolate, holds LAURIE gently by the shoulders.
LAURIE
I should've told you, Dan.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted things between
us to be -- happy.  For a while.  I --
DREIBERG
It doesn't change a thing, Laurie.  I love you.
He tries to pull her close but she turns away, her eyes welling up
with tears.
LAURIE
I love you too, Dan, I -- why don't you give me a minute to get
myself together, okay?
211. EXT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A distraught DREIBERG descends the rope ladder from the OWLSHIP.
RORSCHACH has uncovered a spare blot-mask; with a hiss of
satisfaction he pulls it on over his head.  When he turns, he sees
DREIBERG staring slack-jawed at an inexplicable sight.
Above their heads, the OWLSHIP has begun to glow -- BRIGHT BLUE.
212. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
LAURIE backs against the control panel as an iridescent blue corona
resolves itself into the figure of DR. MANHATTAN.
LAURIE
Jon.  What are you doing here?
DR. MANHATTAN
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
LAURIE
Collect me?
DR. MANHATTAN
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye.
You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
LAURIE
Jon, no -- I can't --
DR. MANHATTAN
It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us
can do anything to change it.
DREIBERG's frantically climbing the ladder.  He pokes his head inside
the cockpit just in time to see LAURIE reaching out for DR.
MANHATTAN's hand.
DREIBERG
LAURIE!  DON'T --
Hands touch.  A shimmering blue halo surrounds DR. MANHATTAN and
LAURIE, and the two of them DISSOLVE.
Stunned, DREIBERG clambers aboard.  There's obviously nothing he can
do.  RORSCHACH is only a second or two behind them.
RORSCHACH
Where's Laurie?
DREIBERG
I don't think she's coming with us.
DISSOLVE TO:
213. EXT. MARS - NIGHT
A BLUE SLIT opens in the sky, mere inches above the Martian
surface;  DR. MANHATTAN steps placidly through, and a moment later
LAURIE tumbles out behind him.  She takes a couple of halting steps,
then GASPS SOUNDLESSLY -- and PITCHES FORWARD onto the shifting red
sands.
DR. MANHATTAN's gone several paces before he realizes there's a
problem.  Eventually, though, he turns -- and spots LAURIE clawing at
the air, trying and failing to draw a breath.  He walks patiently back
and extends his hand;  LAURIE grabs it, and is magically surrounded by
a HALO OF OXYGEN.
DR. MANHATTAN
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
LAURIE
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Ignoring her, he turns.  She hurries to keep pace with him.  Then she
stops in her tracks.
Before her, in the distance, looms DR. MANHATTAN's new abode: a
PALACE OF GLASS, vast and resplendent, towering over the barren
sands.  At its heart stands a gargantuan, ruby-colored HOURGLASS,
surrounded by an intricate system of gears and ratchets, spires and
pendulums . . . the guts of a clock, transfigured into a shimmering
crystalline castle.
DR. MANHATTAN
I live here now.
He strides placidly forward.  LAURIE, boggled, stumbles along after
him.
CUT TO:
214. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT
TIGHT ON the distraught DREIBERG, his pained face illuminated by the
glow of the instrument panel.  RORSCHACH sits calmly behind him.
RORSCHACH
Heading south.  What's the plan?
DREIBERG
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're
hightailing it down to Adrian's.
RORSCHACH
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
DREIBERG
(exploding)
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to
end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't
matter.
RORSCHACH
Coward.  Giving up.
DREIBERG
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
RORSCHACH settles back, lets out a soft, thoughtful HISS.
RORSCHACH
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.
(pause)
Sorry about Laurie.
DREIBERG
(choked voice)
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
For a few moments they fly on in silence.  RORSCHACH can't leave well
enough alone.  Deep in thought, he scratches his chin.
RORSCHACH
Veidt's not stupid.  Could have angle.  -- Might be good move.
CUT TO:
215. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT
LAURIE follows DR. MANHATTAN up a ruby-crystal stairway which spirals
around the exterior of his great glass castle.  Off to her side, the
enormous gears and ratchets which rim its core are SHIFTING, MESHING
-- like the quartz movement of a fine Swiss watch.
LAURIE
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
DR. MANHATTAN
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me
you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
LAURIE
You -- you know about me and Dan?
He gives her a cryptic smile and marches up to the next level.
DR. MANHATTAN
Time is the key, Laurie.  If I can unlock the origins of time, I'll
finally be able to reconcile quantum physics and relativity.
LAURIE looks at him crosseyed -- and heaves a sigh.
LAURIE
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?
(flustered)
Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks
at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of
atoms.
DR. MANHATTAN
(startled)
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
LAURIE
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
DR. MANHATTAN
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even
my responses.
(nodding)
We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  --
Thirty seconds.
She GROANS in frustration as they reach a balcony near the pinnacle
of the huge glass tower.  The Martian plains spread out for miles
below them; above, the stars stretch to infinity.  A chill, violent
WIND whips across their faces.
DR. MANHATTAN
I'll be here for the next year or so.  Then I'm going to work my way
out toward the edge of the universe.
(staring out at the landscape)
Utterly uncorrupted by man.  Isn't it beautiful?
She moves to the edge of the balcony, gazes off at the bleak and
fissured Martian surface.  Suddenly she feels very alone -- and
frightened.
LAURIE
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me
once?
DR. MANHATTAN
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
LAURIE
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be
being with me.
DR. MANHATTAN
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't
know what did.
LAURIE
But you knew that I'd -- die.
DR. MANHATTAN
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to
dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .
(pause)
You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
LAURIE's blood runs cold as she realizes what he's telling her.
LAURIE
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've
always known.
DR. MANHATTAN
(nodding)
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
He walks a few paces up the crystalline steps and surveys the
forbidding Martian landscape.  Behind him, LAURIE buries her face in
her hands.
DR. MANHATTAN (cont.)
Do you understand me, Laurie?  Do you see what it's been like for me
these last years?  Knowing that everything I knew and loved would be
destroyed . . . and that by leaving Earth, I would be the helpless
agent of its destruction?
LAURIE
(sobbing)
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
DR. MANHATTAN
Because --
LAURIE
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.
(angrily)
Jon.  This, this ""script"" you're following . . . who writes it?
DR. MANHATTAN
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six
hundred years.
That about tears it for LAURIE.  She storms over and grabs him by the
shoulders:
LAURIE
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to
die I want to be with -- other people.
DR. MANHATTAN
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a
universe to explore.  I'll be alone.
(reaching for her hand)
You're the last human being I'll ever see.
CUT TO:
216. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP streaking through the icy stratosphere above the south
Atlantic.  Suddenly it BOUNCES in midair -- JERKS to the right -- and
begins to SPIRAL DOWNWARD into the clouds . . .
217. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG is frantically throwing switches as they lurch to and fro.
Finally he manages to get the ship righted.  RORSCHACH's taken a bad
tumble; he picks himself up off the cabin floor and asks:
RORSCHACH
What happened?
DREIBERG
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some
kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
RORSCHACH
What caused it?
DREIBERG
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --
(apprehensively)
-- outside of a nuclear blast.
DISSOLVE TO:
218. EXT. ANTARCTICA - KARNAK - NIGHT
VEIDT'S VAST COMPLEX is little more than a DIM GLOW, barely visible
through a SWIRLING BLIZZARD.
219. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
VEIDT sits before his VIDEO WALL, sipping mulled wine from a goblet.  Almost simultaneously, two SCREENS -- labeled ³MOSCOW² and ³WASHINGTON, D.C.² -- go to SUDDEN BLINDING WHITE.
A second later, the screens show nothing but RANDOM VIDEO NOISE.  VEIDT leans back in his chair and cocks an eyebrow, seemingly unperturbed.
220. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP streaks downward through a TOTAL WHITEOUT.
221. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
Through the cockpit, KARNAK¹s visible -- for an instant.  Then, it¹s lost in the snows again.
DREIBERG
I¹m taking her down.
(frantically throwing switches)
Radar¹s blown.  I¹ll have to wing it.  Strap in, Rorschach --
The SHIP ROCKS with the force of a premature IMPACT.
222. EXT. ANTARCTICA - ON OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The OWLSHIP takes a HARD BOUNCE against the snow.  The hull CRUMPLES as the craft TIPS SIDEWAYS and plows into a DEEP DRIFT.
A HATCH springs open, and DREIBERG and RORSCHACH dig their way out.  They¹re slightly underdressed for the weather.  Spotting the lights of KARNAK in the distance, they turn up their collars and PRESS ON.
223. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
VEIDT¹s eyeing the closed-circuit SECURITY MONITOR which shows the exterior of the complex.  He spots TWO TINY FIGURES slogging through the blizzard.
As he watches, the screens for ³LONDON² and ³PARIS² go WHITE.
224. EXT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER
DREIBERG and RORSCHACH, half-frozen and covered in frost, make it to the great metal entry doors -- and START BANGING.  A VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the door rotates into position.  A soothing, computerized WOMAN¹S VOICE announces:
VOICE
Welcome to Karnak.  Please identify yourself.
DREIBERG
Adrian!  It¹s Dreiberg.  For God¹s sake open the doors.
Nothing happens.  DREIBERG POUNDS against the doors.
DREIBERG (cont.)
Adrian!  We¹re freezing to death out here!
He slumps to the ground exhausted, barely able to draw a breath.  The snow lies in FOUR-FOOT DRIFTS against the door.
RORSCHACH
. . . He¹s not coming, Daniel.
225. INT KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
On the surveillance monitor, RORSCHACH and DREIBERG shamble off.  VEIDT stands, hits his remote.  The picture dies -- leaving a mere 199 screens in operation.
The wall is now checkerboarded with monitors showing nothing but VIDEO SNOW.  As VEIDT strides calmly out of the room, ³PRAGUE² goes white.
226. EXT. KARNAK - NIGHT
DREIBERG on his knees, half-buried in snow.  He topples forward, unable to go on.  A PAIR OF GLOVED HANDS enter frame and YANK HIM UPWARD.
DREIBERG
Can¹t move . . . we¹re done for.
RORSCHACH
Come on.  Found an exhaust vent.
RORSCHACH drags the helpless DREIBERG around the side of the complex, where SNOW blows in flurries at the mouth of a TUNNEL-LIKE STRUCTURE.
RORSCHACH (cont.)
Veidt.  It¹s been Veidt all along.  He¹ll pay for this.
227. INT. KARNAK - DINING HALL - NIGHT
VEIDT alone at a long table in his cavernous dining hall, coolly eating dinner.  Behind him, above the mammoth entry doors, hangs a TAPESTRY -- Alexander slicing through the Gordian Knot.
TWO BATTERED FIGURES creep silently into the hall.
VEIDT sits calmly, betraying nothing.  At his side, the MUTANT LYNX
growls.  His hand closes tightly around the scruff of the animal's
neck: quiet, girl.
RORSCHACH reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a RHODOPSIN
FLASHER -- the same weapon CAPT. METROPOLIS used in the opening
scene.  Suddenly . . .
RORSCHACH
VEIDT!
VEIDT WHIRLS.  He flings a PLATTER, Frisbee-style, across the hall;
it catches RORSCHACH on the chin and sends him sprawling.  DREIBERG
backs against a wall in horror as the LYNX comes sprinting toward
him, TEETH BARED.
VEIDT claps his hands twice, and the CAT relents.  He reaches for a
futuristic STUN GUN, which has been lying on the table all along --
part of the place setting -- and advances on his old colleagues.
DREIBERG
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
RORSCHACH
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
DREIBERG
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
VEIDT
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of
course . . .
DREIBERG
The missing scientists.
VEIDT
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked
at Gila Flats.
RORSCHACH
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
VEIDT
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save
the world.
228. INT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
Gun in hand, VEIDT marches them through the halls of Karnak.
RORSCHACH throws an occasional glance behind him; the LYNX is nipping
at his heels.
VEIDT
Blake thought the Russians were trying to spirit off our researchers
-- to create their own nuclear superman.  It wasn't Russia.
(tapping his chest)
It was me.  When he figured that out, of course I had to kill
him.  The rest of it -- Rorschach's capture, my ""assassination"" --
that was just to keep you busy.  All that really mattered was getting
rid of Dr. Manhattan.
DREIBERG
What??
VEIDT
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
RORSCHACH
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
VEIDT
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.
(smiling)
He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a
little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates
cancer.
DREIBERG
Laurie?  You're responsible for --
VEIDT reaches into his pocket for his gold cigarette case.  He pulls
out a smoke and strikes it against the box.
VEIDT (cont.)
One thing I've learned about cancer -- it's much easier to generate
than it is to cure.
DREIBERG, enraged, CHARGES at him.  The LYNX roars.  VEIDT swings the
stun gun across DREIBERG's face, knocking him to the floor -- and
LEVELS the futuristic weapon DIRECTLY AT HIS HEAD.
VEIDT
Let's get something straight.  If you try that again, I'll kill you
without a moment's thought.
They've reached the entrance to VEIDT's information room.  200
SCREENS blink and flicker as he waves the gun, gesturing them
inside.
RORSCHACH
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
VEIDT
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking
at.
229. INT. INFORMATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
VEIDT points them over to the monitor in the bottom right-hand
corner.  Onscreen, the young JON OSTERMAN sits in a lab at Gila
Flats, reassembling a WATCH.
DREIBERG
What is this?  It looks like Jon.
VEIDT
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr.
Manhattan.
DREIBERG
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
VEIDT
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
CUT TO:
230. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN peers off the edge of a balcony while, behind him,
LAURIE dines at a sumptuously appointed table.  She feels as if she's
hit the jackpot in some freakish contest -- Win A Dream Date On
Mars.
DR. MANHATTAN
I almost envy you, Laurie.  In my present form I can't die.  It's a
mystery I'd like to penetrate.
LAURIE
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
DR. MANHATTAN
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
LAURIE
(shaking her head)
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
DR. MANHATTAN
You're the only human being I care for.
LAURIE
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter
a bit.
(pause)
I want you to cure me.
DR. MANHATTAN
I won't do that.
LAURIE
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
DR. MANHATTAN
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
LAURIE
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you
-- then do it.
Eyes wild, she GRABS his great blue HAND -- and THRUSTS IT into her
chest, where it DISAPPEARS UP TO THE WRIST.
Her fingers tighten around his forearm.  Their GAZES LOCK.  DR.
MANHATTAN shuts his eyes and grimaces, as if he's got to make the
hardest decision of his life.  And then . . .
A BRILLIANT BLUE AURA engulfs them both.  It SPREADS and GROWS IN
INTENSITY, suffusing the sky, finally BLOTTING OUT the vast Martian
landscape altogether.
With a sudden POP the aura begins to die.  For a split-second we see
the figures of LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN suspended against a great
white VOID.  Then colors begin to appear; the crystal castle and the
Martian desert gradually materialize around them.
The two of them stumble back from each other and stand there like
statues, awestruck.  Neither one seems quite sure what's happened.
LAURIE
What -- am I --
DR. MANHATTAN
Cured, yes.
Utterly spent, he staggers to the edge of the balcony, grabs a
handrail for support.  He looks like a man who's just had a heart
attack.
LAURIE
Jon, what is it?  What's the matter?
When he looks up at her, he's DESOLATE -- his face filled with
DREAD.
DR. MANHATTAN
Something. . .incomprehensible has happened.  It's all gone blank on
me.  -- I can't remember the future.
Slowly -- very slowly -- she draws near and puts her arms around
him.
LAURIE
Jon.  Let's go back to Earth.
CUT TO:
231. INT. KARNAK - LAB AREA - NIGHT
VEIDT, DREIBERG, and RORSCHACH enter a lab space which puts the I.F.
room at Gila Flats to shame.  In the midst of the massive whirring
machinery sits a GLOWING BLUE DOME -- a BUBBLE of PURE ENERGY.
Inside its shimmering contours is a little corner of GILA FLATS.  JON
OSTERMAN tightens a screw, and sets the movement of JANEY's watch into
its brass housing -- totally oblivious to the strange trio watching
him from twenty-four years in the future.
VEIDT
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.
(pause)
Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
DREIBERG
What is it?  How does it work?
VEIDT
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow
backward in time.
(smiling)
There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing
parallel to our own --
DREIBERG
Adrian -- you've lost it.
VEIDT
(pointing at the tachyon bubble)
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there.
(pause)
In some of them -- only a few -- the human race survives.  And it
survives because Dr. Manhattan never existed.
He draws closer to the tachyon bubble.  Off to one side is the CAMERA which feeds the monitor in the VIDEO ROOM -- and beside it, mounted on a tripod, is a HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPIC RIFLE.
VEIDT (cont.)
The creation of Dr. Manhattan was a flashpoint in history.  He threw the world balance of power totally out of whack.  And his absence -- for even a week -- virtually guaranteed a catastrophic war.
(wild-eyed)
Do you understand now?  Do you see what I¹m going to do?  I¹m going to change the past!
232. EXT. OUTER SPACE - THAT MOMENT
DR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE materialize in orbit around the earth, enveloped in a BUBBLE OF OXYGEN.  Far below, the nuclear birds are already aloft; TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT flash over New York and San Francisco.
LAURIE
We¹re too late.
DR. MANHATTAN
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
LAURIE
Jon -- what??
DR. MANHATTAN
The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.
233. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT
Inside the tachyon chamber, JON OSTERMAN fits the glass crystal back into place on JANEY¹s watch.  VEIDT looks on in fascination.
VEIDT
At first we could only watch the past.  Now we can reach out and touch it.
He steps over to the rifle, peers through the telescopic sight.
VEIDT
It ate up enough megawatts to light the eastern seaboard for a year and a half -- but last week I managed to open a dime-sized hole for almost three seconds.
(turning to face them)
In a minute I¹ll do it again.  And if my aim is true, I¹ll put a bullet through Jon Osterman¹s heart . . . and Dr. Manhattan will never be born.
DREIBERG and RORSCHACH trade looks of disbelief.
RORSCHACH
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
DREIBERG
Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
VEIDT
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?
DREIBERG
And what if you¹re wrong?
VEIDT
I¹m not.
DREIBERG
What if you¹re wrong??
VEIDT
Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!
(shouting)
I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
234. EXT. ANTARCTICA - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A POCKET OF BLUE HAZE materializes in the snow-swept skies above KARNAK.  Inside it: LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN.
DR. MANHATTAN
That¹s it.  That¹s the source of the time disturbance.
LAURIE
Jon, where are we?
DR. MANHATTAN
Veidt¹s complex.
235. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT
Twenty-four years ago, JON OSTERMAN is packing his jeweler¹s tools, folding his swatch of black velvet.  In the present, VEIDT is raving:
VEIDT
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years
chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . .
as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
DREIBERG
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist
bullshit is going to save the world?
VEIDT
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
He kicks a floor switch.  GIANT NUCLEAR GENERATORS begin to hum.
Then he bends over the rifle and peers through the sight.
236. VEIDT'S POV - THROUGH CROSSHAIRS
In the past, JON OSTERMAN is reaching for his lab coat when he hears
a SQUEAK.  He picks up a broom . . .
237. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT
A LUMINESCENT WHITE SPOT appears on the surface of the tachyon
bubble.  There's a hideous WHINE as a tiny HOLE begins to open up
--  DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF VEIDT'S RIFLE.  His finger closes around the
trigger . . .
. . . and with a TERRIBLE CRASH, the LAB WALL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM.
VEIDT DIVES BACKWARD, DODGING RUBBLE . . .
. . . as a BLUE GIANT, THIRTY FEET TALL, steps into the lab -- with
LAURIE at his side.
DR. MANHATTAN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
VEIDT
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
DR. MANHATTAN stares down at the TACHYON BUBBLE and sees
himself -- his former self -- chasing a MOUSE out of
the I.F. chamber at Gila Flats.  His eyes go wide.  Even he's
surprised.
In the ensuing panic, DREIBERG dives at VEIDT.  VEIDT manages to
sidestep him, frantically trying to get to his rifle.  The HOLE IN
THE BUBBLE has grown to the size of a quarter.
VEIDT lunges toward the rifle.  LAURIE's directly in his path.  He
shoves her aside; they grapple; he flings her to the ground and
points his STUN GUN directly at her --
-- and a millisecond later, he¹s aiming at NOTHING.  DR. MANHATTAN has instantaneously TELEPORTED LAURIE across the room, out of his line of fire.
VEIDT looks up in horror, just in time to see a BLUE BOLT OF LIGHTNING launching itself from DR. MANHATTAN¹s outstretched finger --
VEIDT
NO!!!!
-- and in the wink of an eye, he¹s VAPORIZED.  All that¹s left is a pair of CHARRED BOOTS, still standing upright.
DREIBERG rushes over to LAURIE, takes her in his arms.
LAURIE
What was he doing?
DREIBERG
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
DR. MANHATTAN stares at the TACHYON BUBBLE, mesmerized.  Inside, the door to the I.F. chamber has just swung SHUT on a terrified JON OSTERMAN.
DR. MANHATTAN
He was right.
RORSCHACH, LAURIE, and DREIBERG stare up at the blue behemoth in puzzlement.  DR. MANHATTAN begins to shrink to normal size.  He runs his hand over the surface of the tachyon bubble; BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS shoot off in all directions.
DR. MANHATTAN
He did it.  Veidt broke the code.  It¹s so elegant.  It¹s so obvious.
DR. MANHATTAN¹s off in another world, as usual.  He wears a BEATIFIC SMILE as he watches his own imminent destruction in the tachyon chamber.
LAURIE
Jon --
DR. MANHATTAN
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
LAURIE
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
DR. MANHATTAN
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
He lifts his arms; PARTICLES OF LIGHT appear from nowhere and whiz
around his body like superaccelerated fireflies.  The lights in the
room dim; it's as if DR. MANHATTAN is absorbing all the power of the
world into his own massive frame.
DR. MANHATTAN
My work here is finished . . .
The others cower.  They sense that something large is about to
happen.  In the past, JON OSTERMAN is pounding on the glass of the
test chamber; in the present, DR. MANHATTAN reaches out to touch the
tiny
hole in time.
He does, and in a BLAZE of BLINDING BLUE LIGHT the tiny rift EXPANDS
into a SHIMMERING FISSURE.  DR. MANHATTAN PEELS BACK ITS EDGES AND
STEPS THROUGH . . . INTO THE PAST.
238. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT
JON OSTERMAN turns away from the observation panel.  To his utter
bewilderment, a HUGE BLUE FIGURE -- surrounded by sparks and smiling
gloriously -- has materialized in the chamber behind him.
DR. MANHATTAN
Don't be afraid, Jon.  I'll be here with you.
A second before the particle cannons kick in, DR. MANHATTAN steps
forward -- and FUSES WITH JON, their bodies becoming one.
For a moment JON is still visible, with DR. MANHATTAN's frame
surrounding him, like a translucent shield of pure energy; then DR.
MANHATTAN coalesces into a solid protective HUSK around him.  As the
chamber begins to glow, a network of HAIRLINE CRACKS spreads across
the shell of his body.  BLUE LIGHT spills through the seams; he
spreads his hands -- no in pain, but in triumph; and with a blinding
FLASH, DR. MANHATTAN explodes outward, a million fragments merging
with nothingness . . .
. . . to expose a dumbstruck JON OSTERMAN in his place.  The blue
light dims and the chamber reverts to normal.  Miraculously, he's
alive -- astonished, but perfectly intact.
239. INT. GILA FLATS TEST LAB - A MOMENT LATER
The timelocked door pops open and JON staggers out into the midst of
his awed colleagues, who've seen everything through the observation
panel.
SCIENTIST
What in the name of God . . .
The SCIENTISTS advance cautiously toward the chamber.  JANEY,
sobbing, rushes forward and throws her arms around the dazed JON.  As
she clings to him, her face pressed tightly against his chest, he
looks down at his hands; his fist is still closed around . . .
JON
Your watch, Janey.  I fixed your watch --
SCIENTIST II
LOOK!!
The SCIENTIST is staring wide-eyed at the rear wall of the chamber .
. . which isn't there.  Instead, there's a rippling, irregular
RUPTURE -- a pulsating HOLE IN TIME -- and visible beyond it are
three odd-looking and very frightened figures: DREIBERG, LAURIE, and
RORSCHACH.
240. REVERSE ANGLE - VEIDT'S LAB - THE PRESENT
DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH stare THROUGH the rupture at the
astounded SCIENTISTS.
LAURIE
What happened -- ?
DREIBERG
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
LAURIE
Where did he go?
Before DREIBERG can suggest an answer, the cleft in time begins to
THROB and SHIMMER, slowly SEALING ITSELF OFF before their eyes.  For
a moment everything's back to normal --
-- and then, to their mounting horror, the room they're in begins to
DISSOLVE AROUND THEM . . . FADING AWAY INTO A BLANK WHITE VOID.
A sudden percussive POP.  The white void seems to shrivel around
them, collapsing into a protective bubble of force as they plunge
into . . .
241. EXT. VORTEX EFFECT
DREIBERG, LAURIE and RORSCHACH spinning and tumbling through an
otherdimensional funhouse of sound and color.  If space and time
could be compressed into a single extravagant E-ticket joyride, this
would be it.  Their bodies contract and distend, warp and elongate;
their tortured mouths emit soundless shrieks; and then, before they
know it, they find themselves deposited --
242. EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT
-- smack in the middle of a busy intersection.  The three of them
materialize from nowhere; a southbound VAN swerves to avoid them,
slamming into a row of parked cars, and a northbound TAXICAB does the
same, knocking over a fire hydrant.
LAURIE
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
DREIBERG
Those cars.  What year is this??
LAURIE
Everything's changed --
It's a disorienting world they've landed in.  In fact, it's
our world, our New York, and everything -- the cars,
the clothing, the very look of the city -- seems just a trifle out of
whack . . .
RORSCHACH
Hnrrrrr -- we never happened.
BYSTANDERS cluster about, laughing and taunting, highly amused by the
obvious puzzlement of the freakish trio in their midst.  There are, of
course, no costumed heroes in our world, and their sudden
presence prompts a Babel of speculation among the onlookers:
Nuts?  Fruits?  Out-of-work actors?
RORSCHACH takes a swing at one of the curious, who gets a touch too
close, and the mood begins to turn hostile.  The CROWD, now grown to
several dozen people, is threatening to block the intersection
altogether; a MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides up on his stallion and blows a
shrill WHISTLE.
DREIBERG
Oh my God, they still ride around on horses!
243. EXT. NEWSSTAND - THAT MOMENT
The same newsstand we've seen all along -- but luckily, here in our
world, the headlines are only mildly discouraging: ""RUSSIAN SUMMIT
TALKS COLLAPSE.""  Like everyone else, our old friend the NEWS VENDOR
is gapin at the ruckus on the street.
NEWS VENDOR
Jesus Christ, it must be Halloween.
His sidekick, the small black KID who reads comic books, points to
the befuddled trio on the street and LAUGHS in gleeful recognition.
KID
Shit, man!  It's Rorschach!  And Night Owl!
NEWS VENDOR
What are you talkin' about?
KID
Superheroes!  Check it out!
He thrusts a COMIC BOOK into the NEWS VENDOR's hand and races off to
join the growing throng of rubberneckers.  The NEWS VENDOR stares
down at the costumed characters in the comic book -- ""WATCHMEN"" --
then throws a cockeyed squint at their real-life counterparts on the
street.
KID
All right!  They must be on a case.
244. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
HORNS BLARE.  ALL TRAFFIC HAS STOPPED.  The intersection is mobbed
with curious ONLOOKERS.  By now a half-dozen BEAT COPS have arrived
to clear the streets and restore order.
COP I
Break it up!  Stand back!
COP II
Come on, you three.  If this is some kind of publicity stunt --
DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH have fallen into a tight circle.
They don't know what to expect and they're poised for a brawl.  The
taunting crowd gives them plenty of room; even the COPS are hesitant
to advance.
LAURIE
Dan -- what do we do now?
DREIBERG
(panicked)
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
LAURIE
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't
they -- ?
RORSCHACH
They'd better.
And on RORSCHACH's final vicious HISS, we SHOCK CUT TO BLACK and
FADE OUT.

I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older

She a drug, got a fast release
Got me sprung, wrapped in sheets
Wake up, fuck, and then we going back to sleep

Uh, me and you on an island
With the ocean color stuck in your iris
We comfortable in silence
But I prefer it when we wilding
Sundress, nothing underneath as we undress (Woo!)

Couple of broken people
Trying to complete each other under one breath

6WSkgEE44Z1OSnRBFiFNV2,Don't Start Now - Regard Remix,Dua Lipa,['Regard'],https://open.spotify.com/track/6WSkgEE44Z1OSnRBFiFNV2,45,"Normally I like to give albums quite a few listens before I solidify my opinion on them, but since I have to listen to a new album each day I can't necessarily do that, so these are very much based on first impressions...
1. Royal Blood - Typhoons
I had this on in the background so I wasn’t really that focused on it, but there were a couple of moments that grabbed my attention, namely the twisted outro to ""Limbo"" and the groovy riffing on ""Mad Visions"". ""Boilermaker"" went pretty hard too. The lyrics are prеtty unremarkable, and the dancе-rock fusion is nothing RB's predecessors haven't dabbled in before, but it was overall enjoyable.
2. Baby Strange - Land of Nothing EPLand of nothing... of value! Ha-ha-ha!
In honesty, this was OK but nothing special. The chorus of ""More! More! More!"" is offensively generic, but there’s definitely something to be said for the appropriately chaotic dance beat of ""Club Sabbath"" and anti-religious energy of ""I Want to Believe"", but it's nothing I haven't heard the Strokes or the Arctic Monkeys bash out before.
3. HMLTD - Don't Leave Me EPIt's an interesting concept - the EP contains just 3 examples from over 6400 possible reworkings of the same base song (I think, it's quite confusing, but you can read more about it here). As for the examples we have, ""Don't Leave Me"" is pretty straightforward new-wavey stuff, and ""Do This By Yourself"" has some cool bassy elements but it's far too crammed with sound to be fully enjoyed. However, it’s ""Love Is Not Enough"" where the EP really lights up, with it’s scratchy string opening giving way to a paradoxical sense of upbeat melancholy, like a mid-'80s Cure reworked for the modern age.
4. Rage Against the Machine - Rage Against the Machine
They certainly do be raging, holy moly!
Actually, what’s extremely striking is how relevant so many of the songs like ""Killing in the Name"" and ""Take the Power Back"" are today, particularly in light of last year's events. When I first read the song titles I assumed I'd be force-fed a plateful of empty revolutionary sloganeering, but the Machines (the Rages? The Ragers? The Againsts?) actually deal with some topics that wouldn't really come to the fore of political discussion until almost 30 years down the line. Music-wise, Zack says ""Uh!"" a few to many times for my taste, but there are some cool moments like the guitar scratchings and funky bass work in the opening of ""Killing in the Name"", and the full-on heaviness of the Matrix-featured ""Wake Up"".
Joy Division - Closer (re-listen, but I felt like offering my thoughts)
Unknown Pleasures is a masterpiece of misery, a cold, understated yet rage-filled expression of inner turmoil. Closer contains many of the same elements and is often held in equal regard with their ground-breaking debut, but I struggle to embrace this album with the same enthusiasm. The sound is overall much rougher and harsher than the more atmospheric Unknown Pleasures, and this works well for some of the more intense tracks such as ""Atrocity Exhibition"" and ""Colony"", but it makes tracks like ""Isolation"" and ""Decades"" sound really weird and clattery, like the instruments are being held together with rubber bands (the synths on the latter are particularly embarrassing). ""Decades"" certainly doesn’t come close to holding a candle to ""I Remember Nothing"" as a closing track, and while many praise ""The Eternal"" for its haunting bleakness, I find it a bit, well (*whisper it*) , a bit boring. I do admire the atmosphere, but it's just a little bit slow and dreary for my taste (so says the Cure fan). Having said all that, there is some good news: the wall of guitar in ""Twenty Four Hours"" is one of the coolest sonic choices in the band's discography; Stephen Morris has one of his best drum patterns in ""Heart and Soul""; ""Passover"" is masterfully effective in its simplicity. Closer is still a great record, but its low points leave it falling far short of my expectations.
5. Isabelle Norwood - Basically, I failed Day 5 because I was busy with work for most of the day, but I'm using this piece of music as a placeholder, essentially, as I spent part of the day rehearsing for a recording of it. A friend and coursemate of mine had asked me in to play on her composition (for an elecrtic guitar--'cello--flute trio). It's quite an interesting piece, quite minimalistic in many ways, since it's based on one small motif transformed and repeated throughout. It shouldn't count really since it's only just over 2 minutes long, but she'll be playing on my own (much more miserable and unfocused) composition next week, so I might end up having to repeat this excuse on that day if I don't get a chance to listen to a full album.
6. Dua Lipa - Future Nostalgia
It's compressed as fuuuuuckkkkk.....
It also contains some pretty damn good songs though, and I was surprised that I actually already knew most of them before going into it. ""Don't Start Now"" is the main banger on this record, with its infectiously funky bassline, while ""Levitating"" provides the record with its pop-tastic centrepiece. Most of the tracks are pretty similar, but that just means consistent party vibes all-round, even if it does make anthemic closer ""Boys Will Be Boys"" feel a little out of place. As poignant as it's anti-toxic masculinity is, it feels like a strange way to close the record, especially when it causes such an obvious thematic clash with the sex-fuelled ""Good In Bed"" preceding it in the tracklisting.
7. New Order - Education, Entertainment, Recreation (Live)Bernard's voice doesn't really do justice to the Joy Division tracks included here, but ""Sub-Culture"" goes so hard that it more than makes up for it.
8. India Jordan - Watch Out!
""And Groove"" was a right bastard to transcribe.
9. George Michael - Faith
What genre is this album going for? From the acoustic title track, past dance-y tunes like ""I Want Your Sex"" and ""Monkey"", through to the jazzy closer, George keeps you guessing for the entire ride. Faith is an album that was probably played around the house a lot when I was young, but it's taken me years to finally sit down and listen to it in full. Assessing it with my now older, more mature frame of mind, ""I Want Your Sex"" still prompts a few awkward chuckles (and cringes: ""Sex is something we should do / sex is something for me and you""), while the other dance tracks are decidedly un-danceable. However, despite these moments and the absolute snoozefest that is ""One More Try"", most of these tracks are pretty decent, with the shady narrative of ""Hand to Mouth"" being the mid-album highlight.
10. Dmitri Shostakovich - Symphony No. 8
cond. Valery Gergiev/Mariinsky Theatre
Unlike Shosty's previous war Symphony, the titanic Leningrad, which presents a false sense of optimism before having it crushed by Nazi invaders, the eighth plunges you straight into the realms of despair. The opening movement presents mystery and misery in equal measure, while the barrage of percussion in the following movements creates an energy rivalled only by the ferocious scherzo of the tenth symphony. The final movements perhaps get a little bit tedious after a while, but the tense yet quietly triumphant ending is stunning. He does recycle a lot of the techniques and ideas that I've heard in his other works, but this is nonetheless well worth a listen.
11-13 - Trying to fit these in when I have four pretty significant coursework deadlines for the end of the week is tricky.
14. Röyksopp - Melody AM
This was a nice chilled electronic album to have playing in my ears during a walk in the park. It has a nice blend of upbeat tracks like ""Poor Leno"" and more mysterious ones like the closer. Elsewhere, ""Sparks"" sounds like a remixed Portishead track, while the saxophones at the start of ""She's So"" remind me of something off the back end of Bowie's ""Heroes"".
The Cure - The Cure
Well, I was expecting this to be a lot worse. Yes, it's too long. Yes, this is mostly the fault of ""The Promise"" lasting 10 minutes! It's definitely a lot more raw and heavy than anything Robert and co. had made in the previous couple of decades, but it's not the dodgy nu-metal abomination I was fearing from this record. ""Lost"" is actually pretty great opener, with its unsettling dissonant chords, and ""alt.end"" is a pretty great track from later in the record. The problem is that I can't really remember the other tracks, beyond the fact that they were loud and rocky. It's probably one of their least remarkable records, which makes it even more confusing that they chose it to self-title it, because this is far from being any kind of definitive statement from the band. It also sounds like there's a lot of borederline self-plagiarism on this record, with quite a few lyrical and melodic motifs seemingly lifted from their previous album, Bloodflowers; ""Going Nowhere"" in particular sounds like a leftover from that album.
Still, it surprises me that this is often held in worse regard than Wild Mood Swings, as that album really is awful.
My Bloody Valentine - You Made Me Realise EPThe Sonic Youth influence is pretty obvious on this one, and you can actually hear some of the words! (????) The sound is certainly nowhere near as hypnotic as that of Loveless, but it was still cool to hear the humble genesis of some of those game-changing sounds.
15. The Cure - 4:13 Dream
A few flashes of brilliance but... yeah this wasn't good. I mean what in God's name is ""Freakshow"" supposed to be?
16. 
17. David Bowie - Let's Dance
The first three tracks are Bowie staples so I knew them already, but no matter how often I hear it, those basslines in the title track don't get any less funky. ""Ricochet"" is a cool track later in the record; ""Without You"" is a boring track earlier in the record. ""Shake It"" is a terrible closer and sounds like pathetic remix of the title track. All-in-all, it's a solid new wave album but definitely the start of the downturn for Bowie's studio album output.
18. 10,000 Maniacs - Love Among the Ruins
R.E.M. + viola
19. Interpol - Our Love to Admire
Anyone who dares to speak to me in person about music will know of my absolute adoration for Interpol's debut, Turn on the Bright Lights, and that makes it all the more perplexing that the only other album of theirs that I've ever ventured into is Antics. I, like just about everyone else, had more-or-less written off the rest of their discography owing to what most critics and audiences see as a downward spiral as their career has gone on. This is a real shame because, having listened to it out of sheer curiosity, Our Love to Admire is great! It doesn't step over any boundaries for the band, and some parts of it have Interpol sounding more and more like their own imitators, but there are some genuinely staggering songs on here, from the melancholic opener, through the brilliant ""Rest My Chemistry"" to its atmospheric closer. Definitely worth a listen for TOTBL fans!
20. Sons of Kemet - Black to the Future
The largely instrumental second half of the album was the best part because it was the easiest to transcribe. Of course this only made the finale more hard-hitting.
21. Tom Jones - Surrounded by Time
80 years old and still got it
22. //Interpol - Antics re-listenAntics played loudly in the pitch dark while faceplanted on your bed is underrated.
23. Big L for Lewis Hamilton this weekend. Ouch.
24. Galaxie 500 - On Fire
As per vintagewashingmachine's recommendation...
I feel like I'd have been better off listening to this while lying half-asleep on a deserted hill at 4:00 in the morning, the hazy orange sky hanging over my isolated slumber, a vague blur in the distance. As it was, I was sitting at my desk while dealing with a few song deletion and transcription IQ requests, so not quite the same vibe. One thing's for certain - it's definitely from 1989.
25. Franz Liszt - Grandes Études de Paganini
perf. Daniil Trifonov
The second and third études are nice, but the rest is basically just Liszt showing off with lots of virtuosic hemidemisemiquavers. I kind of wish he'd gone further with the variations at the end, but I suppose that ended up being Rachmaninoff's task to fulfil.
Still, at least it's another ""album"" to add to the Liszt.
26. Franz Liszt - Tasso: Lamento e Trionfo
cond. Alan Gilbert/Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France
I really enjoyed Liszt-ening to this piece.
27. 10,000 Maniacs - MTV Unplugged
To be honest, a lot of these tracks arguably sound better with the Unplugged treatment. The bassoons are very nice indeed.
28. Gang of Four - Entertainment! and The Slits - Cut
Two very different post-punk experiences - Cut is much weirder and very reggae-influenced, while Entertainment! is much closer to its punk roots, with a few dance and noise elements thrown in there too. The Slits are easily the more experimental group, pushing the boundaries of the genre far more than any other post-punk artist I've heard, especially with the spoken samples and the bizarre guitar techniques. What's interesting about Gang of Four is how strikingly modern they sound, as in I wouldn't be surprised if some of their music came up in a 2000s post-punk revival playlist. They certainly seem closer to the likes of Arctic Monkeys and the Libertines than Joy Division or The Cure. I'd recommend both for anyone interested in punk/post-punk, but if I had to pick one it would be Gang of Four, although I think some of those tracks, particularly ""Not Great Men"" and ""Damaged Goods"", sound a lot better in the rough-and-ready live recording I transcribed earlier in the year than they do on this more polished album.",188571,https://images.genius.com/4f430c5a554c7fed088d7c3cbcf16656.1000x1000x1.jpg,0.51,0.697,4,-5.128,0,,0.0326,9.05e-06,0.113,0.515,122.774,0.0543

Flashaback. Ted and Robin are at Robin’s apartment.
Ted : I think I'm in love with you.
Robin : What?!
End of flashback.
Ted (VO) : Well, here's the thing, normal people, you know, people who aren't your dad, usually take longer to say ""I love you."" Robin went through the usual stages.
Flashback. Ted, Robin and Barney are at the apartment.
Robin : Spider! Spider!
Barney : I left something in the hallway.
Ted : Where?
Robin : Right there.
Ted : Got it.
Ted kisses Robin. Barney comes back to the apartment.
Ted (VO) : First there's the moment when you think you think it.
Ted : Whoa, still alive.
Barney leaves the apartment.
Ted (VO) : There's the moment you think you know it.
Robin is sick and in bed :
Robin : Oh, you don't want to kiss me, you'll get sick.
Ted still kisses her. Two days later he’s the one who’s sick.
Ted : Totally worth it.
Ted (VO) : There's the moment where you know you know it, but you can't yet say it.
Ted : All right, it's getting to be that time. I'll talk to you tomorrow?
Robin : Good night.
Ted : Good night.
Robin : Wait, Ted?
Ted : Yeah?
Robin : Good night.
The next morning, Ted walks into Robin’s apartment. Robin’s on the phone.
Robin : Well, great, I'll see you then. Bye, sweetie. (To Ted) Hey. Guess what? My sister Katie is coming to visit next weekend. She gets in on Thursday.
Ted : That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take off work Friday. We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building.
Robin : Really? You'd do that?
Ted : Of course. Everyone should see the Empire State Building.
Ted (VO) : And then there's the moment where you know you know it, and you can't keep it in any longer.
Flashback. At Ted’s apartment.
Robin : Ted.
Ted : Yeah?
Robin :Falafel.
Credits. Robin and lily are at the airport.
Lily :  Falafel?
Robin : Falafel.
Lily :Instead of telling Ted you love him, you said ""falafel""?
Robin :I totally choked.
Lily : I just don't get it. Why can't you tell Ted you love him?
Robin : Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me.
Lily : Oh, God, you'd think you never said it to a guy before. No.
Robin : Okay, well, I don't usually getthis far in the relationship. I usually take the three-week exit.
Lily : Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory.
The whole gang is at the bar
Barney : Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge. Relationships are like a freeway.
Marshall : Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus.
Barney : No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have sex, you exit when she's in the shower.
Robin : So every girl you have sex with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that.
Barney : The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars.
Ted : What?
Barney :Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death. Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life, it's like, ""Are we there yet?""

End of flashback. Back with Robin and Lily.

Robin : So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit.
Lily : Yeah, been there. I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing. Okay, it was Marshall.
Robin : It’s just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it.
Lily : Relax, it'll happen when it happens. Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing.
Robin : Oh, here comes Katie.
Lily : Aw, your sister's so cute.
Robin : Yeah. This reminds me of when I used to see her coming up the driveway from school, with her little pigtails and her Hello Kitty backpack.

Her sister is kissing a boy.

Lily : Hello, Kitty.
Robin : Oh, no. No. No. No.
Katie : Hey, Robin. How are you?
Robin : Oh, good. Good. So, who is this... tongue person?
Katie : Robin, this is my boyfriend Kyle.
Kyle : Looks like hotness runs in the family.
Robin : Oh, you said that. Great. So how long have you two been...?
Katie :Two whole months.
Kyle : Yeah.
Katie : He's actually coming to visit family in New York, too. Isn't that great?
Kyle : My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad, but he buys me beer, so...
Robin : That's cool. This is my friend Lily.
Kyle : Hot.
Robin :You say things! Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled.
Katie :Um, actually, I'm going to stay with Kyle tonight.
Robin : Uh, no, you're not.
Katie : Oh, come on. It's kind of a special night. If you know what I mean.
Robin : What? Oh. Oh...

The whole gang is at the bar.

Robin : I can't believe my baby sister is planning to lose her virginity to a... ...douche with a faux hawk. This can't happen. You guys have to help me talk her out of it.
Marshall : Speech to talk a girl out of having sex.
Ted : Yeah, I don't have any of those.
Barney : Discouraging premarital sex is against my religion.
Robin : Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions.
Lily :  It's 2:00 and you've already had three scotch and sodas.
Robin : That's why I need your help.

They’re all at the Empire State Building.

Ted (VO) : Robin convinced Katie to stay with her that first night. And the next day, I took everybody to the Empire State Building.

Ted : You guys are lucky you came here with an architect. Empire State Building fun
fact number one: When construction began on March 17, 1930, the framework rose at a rate of four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. There it is. There it is. Come on. These are fun facts, guys, let's have fun with them.
Robin :You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long, but I waited to come here with someone special.
Katie : Oh, here we go.
Lily : Marshall and I have never been to the Empire State Building either. But I'm so glad I waited to do something so important with my fiancee.
Marshall : Speaking of waiting, I signed an abstinence pledge in high school. It's totally cool to wait. And stay away from drugs... other than pot.
Katie : You told them?
Robin : Oh, okay, yes, I told them. But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too. Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys?
All : Totally. You should wait.
Barney :Sex is fun.
Robin : See?
Katie : You are such a hypocrite. You were only 16 when you lost yours.
Robin : Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room.
Barney : I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary.
Katie : Look, I've been dating Kyle for two months now. It's like forever. I mean, we've already done everything else. I mean, we've even...
Robin : Oh. La, la, la, la, la.La, la, la, la, la, la, la,la, la, la, la, la.
Marshall : Even Kyle gets to do that.
Katie : You have no right to tell me not to do it.
Robin : But Kyle? Why can't you just wait? Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted.
Katie : Robin, this is happening. Look, I already put it up on my Myspace page. I need a clove.
Robin : You smoke now, too?
Lily : Oh, remember cloves?
Marshall : No!
Robin : No ""Aw, remember cloves?"" This can't happen. She's my baby sister, okay? She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having sex.
Ted : Come on, you were only 16 when you had sex. I was 17.
Marshall : We were 18.
Ted : Barney was probably 12.
Barney : Good one, Ted. I was, uh, six... fourt... How old were you again?
Ted : 17.
Barney : Dude, me, too.
Lily : Barney, you okay?
Barney : Yeah, of course. What, you don't believe me? - It was at camp, so I'm...
Marshall : What camp?
Barney : This place in the Catskills. Look it up. I was there teaching for the summer.
Robin : What did you teach?
Barney : Uh, dance.
Ted : Dance?
Barney : Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby.

Flashback. Where Barney work that summer.
Barney : Sylvia
Sylvia : Yes, Mickey?
Barney :How you call your loverboy?
Sylvia : Come here, loverboy
Barney : And if he doesn't answer
Sylvia : Oh, loverboy
Barney : And if he still doesn't answer?
Sylvia : I simply say, baby... Oh, baby. My sweet baby
End of flashback. Back to the Empire State Building.
Lily : That's Dirty Dancing.
Ted : It was on last night.
Marshall : No, it was two nights ago. ""She's Like the Wind"" has been stuck in my brain for about 40 hours. I just got it out. Now it's back in. Damn you, Swayze!
Lily : Do you remember our first time?
Marshall : Yeah. It was back in college.
Flashback. 1996. In Marshall and Ted’s college room. Marshall and lily are kissing.
Lily : Oh, wait, wait. Look... I really want to do this, but... we should make it special, you know? Do this right.
Marshall : Okay. You're right. Maybe we could go to the beach and get a house for the weekend.
Lily : Yeah, New Year's Eve.
Marshall : Okay.
Lily : Oh, and we'll light candles and maybe put on some classical music.
Marshall : That's not a good idea.
Lily : Why not?
Marshall : Long story. But maybe we could put on some Al Green and take a bubble bath together.
Lily : Oh, yeah, that sounds so good. Oh, I love you, Marshall. I'm so glad we're waiting. (12 minutes later) : Oops. End of flashback.
Robin : Oh, that's adorable.
Ted : Yeah, tell her what happened next.
Back to Marshall and lily’s flashback.
Marshall : That was amazing.
Lily : Yeah. Want to do it again?
Ted (on the bed of the top): Please don't. End of flashback.
Marshall : We said we were sorry.
Ted : Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?
Marshall : You know what, I loaned you my Walkman.
Lily : The point is no matter what, it's never gonna be as perfect as you want it to be.
Robin : Well, mine was terrible.
Lily : Wait, I've never heard your story.
Robin : Well, as you know, I was 16. And it was with my boyfriend Brian.

Flashback. Robin’s in bed with Brian.
Brian : Ready?
Robin : Yeah.
Brian : This feels so right.
Robin : Oh, I know.
Brian : Oh, Robin.
Robin : Oh, Brian.
Brian : Yeah, I'm gay. End of flashback.

Lily : I'm so sorry.
Robin : Eh, I should've known. There were signs.
Back to Robin’s flashback.
Brian : Oh, my God! My mom's home. Quick! Get under my bed.
Robin : What?! Oh, my God!
End of flashback.
Robin : You only get one shot at losing your virginity. And even though I just barely had sex, it counts.
Lily : What do you mean just barely?
Robin : Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he... splashed around in the shallow end.
Lily : Then you didn't lose your virginity to him. Just barely doesn't count.
Robin : Yes, it does.
Lily : No, it doesn't.
Marshall : Yes, it does.
Lily : No, it doesn't. It doesn't count. End of story.
Barney : Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin, you saucy little harlot. Could it be that before Marshall took a swim, someone else tested the water?
Marshall : No. Nobody else tested the water, right? Scooter?
Barney : Who's Scooter?
Lily : My high school boyfriend, who I did not have sex with.
Marshall : I... I can't believe this. We're Marshall and Lily, when people see us, they say, ""Oh, look at them, they've only had sex with each other.""
Barney : No, Marshall, they say, (with a sad voice) ""Oh, look at them, they've only had sex with each other.""
Marshall : But now that's not true anymore, now you've had sex with twice as many people as I have. I knew that you were too good at it.
Katie : Know what? I don't want to see the stupid Empire State Building anymore.
Ted : It's not stupid.
Katie : I'm going to see Kyle.
Robin : Katie, please. You only get to lose your virginity once. You should only be having sex with someone who's special.
Katie : Oh, please, you've had sex with, like, a hundred guys.
Robin : It's not a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys.
Katie : I'm sure you were madly in love with all of them.
Robin : I had different levels of feeling for each of the... very reasonable number of guys.
Katie : Really. Well, do you love Ted? Do you love Ted ?

Robin : I, um...
Ted : Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 22: The Empire State Building has tons of places where people can have private conversations. ( goes away with Robin) You're off the hook, okay?
Robin : Just let me explain.
Ted : You don't have to explain anything. You don't have to say it-- it's fine.
Robin : Okay, but if relationships are like a freeway, then saying... ""hm hm hm"" is like... getting into the carpool lane. And I don't want to take an exit, but... at the same time, I'm not ready to get into the carpool lane. Because what's in the carpool lane? Oh, it's a big diamond, and I'm just not ready to get...
Ted : Okay, Robin, Robin, stop. It's no big deal, you don't have to say it.
Robin : It's just, it's a big thing to say to someone, and I don't want to say it too soon.
Ted : What, you mean like I did?
Robin :No. I didn't... Yeah, like you did. I mean, you have to admit it, Ted, it was a little weird.
Ted : Weird... or courageous?
Robin : Pretty sure weird. I mean, who gives it up on the first date?
Ted : Well, come on, it shows I'm brave and bold, like a knight.
Robin : No, it shows that you're an I-love-you slut.
Ted : Well, then you're an I-love-you prude. You know what? I take mine back.
Robin : You... What?
Ted : I take my ""I love you"" back.
Robin : You can't take it back.
Ted : Nah. Just did. Got it right here. But, you know, I'm such a slut. I'm just gonna give it away. Hey, you, sir. I love you.
Man : Thank you, man. I was going up there to jump. (the man hugs Ted)
Lily : Marshall, why is this such a big deal?
Marshall : Why is this such a big deal? Oh, uh, sorry, Christopher Columbus, guess who actually discovered the New World. Some dude named Scooter. Oh, uh, Neil Armstrong, it actually goes like this: ""One small step for man, one giant leap for Scooter."" Whoa, hey, Adam, guess who got with Eve before you did...
Lily : Okay, Marshall, I get it.
Marshall : It's a big deal because it rewrites our history.
Lily : No, it doesn't. Look, have you been to the Empire State Building? No. You've only been in the lobby. People don't buy tickets to get in the lobby. They buy tickets to get to the top. Scooter only got in the lobby, and the lobby doesn't count.
Marshall : Really. Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me how to get to the Empire State Building?
Man (the same that talked to Ted) Um, we're in it right now.
Marshall : Thank you, sir. You're a very wise and brilliant man.
Man : You're right. Why would I throw that all away? I'm having the best day!
Robin : Katie, I'll admit, maybe I'm not in any place to lecture you on romantic relationships, but... but I just don't want you to make the same mistakes that I've made.
Katie : Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay.
Robin : That's not what I meant. I just wish you weren't in such a rush to grow up. Please don't do this.

Ted (VO) : But, kids, later that night, Katie did it, and she got pregnant... with quintuplets... and she lived out her days in a trailer park... where she died an alcoholic. So the moral here, kids, don't have sex until you're married. Maybe even, like, a year or two into marriage.
His kids : Dad!
The girl : Come on, what really happened?
Ted (VO) : All right, here's what really happened.
Ted is sitting on the coucha t the apartment when Robin comes in.
Robin : Hey.
Ted : Hey.
Robin : She didn't do it.
Ted : Hey, that's great! You got through to her.
Robin : No, I didn't. You did. She told me that you talked to her.
Flashback. Ted meets Katie et the Empire State Building.
Ted : Hey, Katie.
Katie : Hey. Got another Empire State Building fun fact for me?
Ted : No. I wouldn't bore you with the seven million man-hours it took to build this 102-story testament to human will. So, you okay?
Katie : I don't know what everyone is freaking out about. Kyle, he's a really nice guy. He could've cheated on me with my lab partner Gretchen Gwynn, but he didn't. 'Cause he said he knew I'd find out.
Ted : That's very gallant. Well, I don't know what your sister's freaking out about, either. - I was your age my first time.
Katie : Oh, really?
Ted : Yeah, yeah. It was, uh, it was with this girl, Molly.
Flashback. Ted is on the bed with molly.
Molly : I love you, Ted.
Ted : Oh, I love you, too, Molly. (VO) But I didn't.
Molly : That was amazing.
Ted : Look, I got to go.
Molly : Where are you going?
Ted : My cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going out to the woods to light 'em-- it's gonna be awesome.
Molly : Well, will you call me?
Ted : Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you. (VO) But I didn't. Molly?
Molly : Yeah?
Ted : Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.(VO) But I didn't.
End of flashback. Back to Katie and Ted.
Ted : And I never saw her again. I told her I loved her, but... I just wanted to have sex. I-I would've said anything to make that happen, and... that's exactly what I did. Look, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just telling you what all 17-year-old boys are like. Even the nice ones.
Flashback. Katie’s at Robin apartment.
Katie : So I told Kyle I wanted to wait... and he dumped me.
Robin : Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Aw, honey. I promise everything is gonna be okay. You want to watch The Little Mermaid and drink some YooHoo?
Katie : Only if you put a buttload of Kahlua in it.
Robin : Don't tell Mom.
End of flashbacks. Back to robin and Ted.
Robin : Thanks for doing that.
Ted : You're welcome. I knew it meant a lot to you.
Robin :  But, man, your story, I mean, it doesn't even sound like you.
Ted : Yeah, well...
Flashback. Ted and molly are on the bed.
Ted : I love you, Molly.
Molly : Oh, I love you, too, Ted.
Ted : Wow. That was amazing.
Molly : Look, I got to go.
Ted : Wh-Where are you going?
Molly : Uh, my cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going into the woods to light them. It's gonna be awesome.
Ted : Will you call me?
Molly : Yeah. I'll totally call you. Oh, Ted?
Ted : Yeah?
Molly : Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.
End of flashback.

Ted : But she didn't.
Robin : Oh, come here. I love you. I said it. Feels right. I love you.
Ted : I'm gay. I'm kidding. I love you, too. Hey... you lost your I-love-you-ginity.
Robin : Yeah. I guess I was just waiting for the right guy.
Ted (VO) : Katie ended up having a great first time in New York. And the last thing we did before she left was go to the Empire State Building.
Ted : I am so glad we're finally doing this.
Barney : What are you talking about? We were here yesterday.
Marshall : Yeah, but that didn't really count. Oh, crap.
Lily : Exactly! So yesterday doesn't count as having gone to the Empire State Building. So I lost it to you, Marshall. And I rode that elevator to the top, and I saw that view, and I basked in the awesomeness. And that's our story.
Marshall : Yeah. Yeah, that's our story. We've only had sex with each other.
Lily : We've only had sex with each other.
Barney :They've only had sex with each other.
Ted : Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go. Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 81: There are 1,860 steps from this... (They push him outside the elevator) Whoa, whoa! Come on!
They’re at the bar.
Ted : So, now you guys can finally say you've been to the Empire State Building. How have you lived here so long and never been to the top?
Marshall : Well, we're usually busy... drinking.
Lily :Speaking of first times, we never got to hear your virginity story.
Marshall : That's right, I almost forgot.
Barney : Okay. I was 16, and it was in a baseball dugout...
Marshall : Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
Barney : I mean, I was in a subway with a high-priced call girl...
Ted : Risky Business.
Barney : I was accidentally hacking into NORAD'S computer...
Ted : That's War Games, and there's not even a sex scene in it.
Barney : All right! I was 23, and it was with my mom's 45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda. She called me ""Barry"" the whole time, and for two weeks, my comforter smelled like menthol cigarettes. You happy?
Marshall : Hey... Why don't you tell us again about your first time at the camp in the Catskills.
Barney : Baby and her family spent every summer at Kellerman's. Her dad did not approve of our love.
Ted : Did anyone put Baby in a corner?
Barney : Oh, God, no. What can I say, I... had... the time of my life. True story.",178213,https://images.genius.com/8df98b7141128d2170564f4c81715337.499x511x1.jpg,0.835,0.69,9,-7.114,0,,0.021,0.000527,0.294,0.711,123.074,0.0488

You fucking whore
You fucking whore
You're such a whore
You fucking whore
I might not buy you shit, but I'll never deny you dick
Suck on my cock until your tongue is too tired to lick

I'm a sex legend
Fuckin you like I injected ephedrine
Pump your ass like a jackhammer connected to your rectum
Nothing's affecting my erection
Unless you're in need of dexatrim
And your complexion is infected skin
I wanna hear confessions, bitch, obsessions
Lessons, questions, sexual suggestions
Would you like some refreshments? Some breath mints?
Cause I plan on tonguing you while molesting your intestines
You contain the essence of the profession
Known as prostitution my first impression is you'd be excellent
Your estrogen is like mescaline
If you're not douching your twat, smells like pollution a pestilent specimen
Necro is smooth, especially when making the move
On you removing your clothes whether or not you approve
Don't feel aggression after the molesting
I'd have Gwyneth Paltrow eating Alpo
My deception is for fucking


You're exotic looking
Your twat is hot like narcotics cooking
You should use your body for hooking
Your pussy is like a spot in Brooklyn
New York is full of vagina predators
For fetishes for sluts with pedicures
You're naked, bitch
Smack your pussy lubricate it with spit
I'm raping your clit
You're making faces like you're taking a shit
Sexual narcissist
Nibbling where your cartilage is
Sucking your pussy for juices like oranges
Stenching like the deceased in the morgue
The second I walk into the door
I can smell your pussy like a police dog
Let's see how many dicks we can fit in Mariah
Rub her cunt fast like a caveman rubbing sticks for fire
The plan is to shove you into the back of a van
Bitches screaming with high pitches like a Michael Jackson fan
Better yet like Michael himself
That fucking faggot pedophile should get beaten to death with a spiked belt


If I had Donald Trump's cash I'd have a plump ass
Everyday, sucking em and fucking em with no scumbags
Because I'm a scumbag and yo bitch you're a cunt rag
A fucking dumb hag with fun bags
Every shit is perverse
When the minister squirts
Put on one of your miniskirts
And I'm a fuck you in a church
How can you get a bitch?
An alcoholic beverage is the leverage
In getting a bitch to undress and show you a crevice
This will never miss it's definite
You want to touch the flesh of a tit?
Listen to this professional shit
Put something in her drink that she could digest in a sip
Something that'll dissolve quick
So she won't think she's being tricked
There's narcotics that will make a female feel erotic
Have her sucking cock like she's a demonic psychotic
Your relationship starts off platonic
Next thing you know she's on it

That if, if I lost control
Or did not have control, things would just, you know
I would be… fatal

I'm writing this letter to let you know I'm really leaving
And no, I'm not keeping your shit
Heard you got some new homies
Got some new hobbies
Even a new hoe too
Maybe she can come help you
Maybe she can come lay do after we're done
What's done is done
I don't want nothing else to do with it
Let me tell you a secret
I've been secretly banging your homeboy
Why you in Vegas all up on Valentine's Day?
Why am I so easy to forget like that?
It can't be that easy for you to get like that
Oh no, she didn't, ooh yes, I did
Oh no, she didn't, I'll do it again

Leave me lonely for prettier women
You know I need too much attention for shit like that
You know you wrong for shit like that
I could be your supermodel if you believe
If you see it in me, see it in me, see it in me
I don't see myself
Why I can't stay alone just by myself?
Wish I was comfortable just with myself
But I need you, but I need you, but I need you

Ooh, just get a load of them, they got chemistry
All they could say, we like brother and sister
Look so good together
Bet they fuckin' for real, and they was right
That's why I stayed with ya, the, the dick was too good
It made me feel good for temporary love
You was a temporary lover

Leave me lonely for prettier women
You know I need too much attention for shit like that
You know you wrong for shit like that
I could be your supermodel if you believe
If you see it in me, see it in me, see it in me
